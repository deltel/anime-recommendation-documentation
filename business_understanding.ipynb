        "Anime is a style of animation which originated in Japan. It has become a popular form of entertainment among children and young adults. There is a variety of genre and because of this it provides a source of entertainment for all interests.  \n",
        "\n",
        "It has been around for a number of years with the earliest documented creation being in 1917 (Yamaguchi, 2013). Initially, anime or Japanimation as it was referred to was not popular outside of Japan, but over time this changed. The production has risen to such levels that every season of the year sees new adaptations from manga, the source material for many anime, or outright anime originals â€“ those that have no manga from which they are adapted. With the sheer volume of content out there, it can be difficult to know which anime would suit each individual.  \n",
        "\n",
        "So, even though there are many streaming platforms or many avenues by which one can view anime, it can be very time-consuming to try to filter through all the content to find the best anime for the individual. When he does find one, it is only a temporary reprieve until he must begin the search again. Thus, we see a cycle of searching, trying, liking and searching once that series has been completed. Note that this only includes the happy path. Undoubtedly, there are many times when an iteration leads to frustration instead of satisfaction.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the need arises for a solution that would bring the individual closer to content more suitable for his particular taste and limit the amount of time spent searching for new content. It would also provide the additional benefit of having the individual spend more time engaged in viewing the right content which leads to a better experience overall. This recommendation system would also benefit the providers of the anime as their users would be more satisfied whenever they use the service and more likely to recommend the service to others.\n"
