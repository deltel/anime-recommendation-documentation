         "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a great addition to the Cowboy Bebop series, but no more. It is by no means a sequel, and after watching it, I found that it's best\nwatched in the middle of the series, and not neccesarily at the end. If it's got a specific place or not, that I don't know, but that's not very important at any rate, and if\nyou've watched the entire series, it shouldn't be hard to mentally place it inside the series anyway. This time, a terrorist possesses a weapon capable of killing countless people,\nand there's a bounty of 300 millionwoolongs on him; the largest bounty ever given. Of course, this means that our heroes will chase him. And so starts the process of gathering\ninformation, meeting and getting to know people related to the bounty in some way, and eventually, squaring off against him in a final fight. Oh, and throw in a save-the-world\nthing this time, and there you have the movie. Nothing really new, a formula that's been used several times. There's also details here and there left unexplained, and things  may\njust happen for no reason at the rare occasion. Its 120 minutes might be a little too long to some, but it never came off as boring at any point to me; they certainly did a good\njob of fleshing out those 120 minutes.   Though, that may be credited more to the characters than the plot itself, as the movie threw some really interesting characters at us. The\norignal cast is, well, pretty much the same as they always are, the same characters which you (probably) got to love while watching the original series. As for the movie\ncharacters, we have for example Vincent, the main bad guy. He's quite the interesting fellow, though the more I think about it, the more I can't help but feel that I've experienced\nhis type somewhat before - he's got a mysterious past; a forgotten love included, he's going to kill loads of people for no good reason, and he blathers out sentences about\nreligion and whatnot. Nevertheless, he comes off as an interesting character, mostly because of him being similar to Spike - both in physical prowess and their considering\nthemselves 'dead' men due to past events. Then we have Electra, Vincent's past love once forgotten. She remembers him though, and well, she wants him to remember her as well. We\ncan see where that's heading...  The animation quality is superb; its detail and overall quality is unmistakably a work done by people who knows what they are doing. Be it\nbackgrounds or landscapes, they're all top-notch. Lighting effects are good, and more than I'd exect from something out of 2001, and the overall quality of special effects are\ngreat; much, much better than the original series. The character designs are the same old, with some improvements, and they work very well with this anime and movie. The character\nmotions and their fluidity are great, and the few action scenes in the movie are done so well that I could probably learn some nice figthing moves merely from studying them. The\ncoloring is the only thing that's a bit behind, but considering its age it's not a problem. And moreso, the dulled coloring actually melds perfectly with the style of the movie,\nand helps on the movie's atmosphere.  The soundtrack is what you should expect from the original series; awesome. Yoko Kanno does her work as she did in the series; with an amazing\nsoundtrack that fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie and its individual scenes, and the opening and ending themes are wonderful to listen to. The only downside is that\nthere is a lot of silent scenes, where no background music is present at all.   Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door is a movie that delivers the goods, but stops at that. It's\nnot marvelous, but it's great, and a must-see movie for any Cowboy Bebop fan.",

         "I'm never that comfortable with films of series. Mostly, that's because all too often a film of a series consists of some kind of edited-all-to-hell clip show that tries and\ntotally fails to boil down the story of a long series to a relatively much shorter film. Knockin' on Heaven's Door isn't that, which is very much in its favour. Rather, it's\nbasically like a two-hour &quot;lost episode&quot; that belongs somewhere in the middle of the series - without spoiling anything, by the end of the series, there's characters\nmissing who are still present in this film. Another point in the film's favouris that it's pretty much equally accessible for existing fans and those unfamiliar with the\ncharacters.  While there's plenty of details that might be lost or not fully comprehensible for new viewers, by and large the film stands up well as a stand alone drama,\nintroducing its characters and their situation.  However, this in a way exposes another major weakness of films of series.  Series are, by nature, episodic.  They devote an episode\nto introducing a character or exploring their personalities.  Once this is done, they generally have plot episodes, in which the main thrust of the series is pursued, and then they\nhave one-shot episodes that have our characters in some kind of interesting situation, but which is basically unrelated to the plot - if there is one.  Films, by contrast, do all\nof this at once.  The proceedure is totally different, and a director or scriptwriter used to a series format adapts less well to a film format.   Knockin' on Heaven's Door\nexemplifies this - while the film as it is works, it's more obvious and cumbersome than a film directed by a director used to a feature-length format.  The storyline, also, suffers\nin this way.  It's not that it's a bad story, in fact it might make a great two- or three-part episode, but as a film, the material comes across as stretched, holey and lacking in\nsubstance.  It's also remarkable in that it's not half as quirky or original as Cowboy Bebop's famously eclectic mixtures of ideas: biological terrorism unleashed by a madman with\na mysterious and sinister military past, fascinated by death and bent on destroying the world, with cod philosophical pretentions to fil gaps between action and a garnish of some\nfashionable christian mythology. It's all very generic really, and frankly the only things that make this Cowboy Bebop and not something much more generic are the familiar\ncharacters, who are luckily strong enough to make the thing hang together.  The new characters are not much to speak of, either - Vincent the aforementioned madman, a hacker\naccomplice, a Moroccan information seller and, of course, Electra, a tough, wildcard femme fatale with a mysterious connection to our antagonist.  Electra comes off as the best\nrealised of these, and, perhaps not coincidentally, closest to a series character (though she's a dead ringer for a more mature version of BGC2040's Priss as well).  Vincent seems\nvery like main series antagonist Vicious stripped of his hatred of Spike, which is to say, not that special and a bit rabid and foaming for credibility.  The film drags.  It's just\ntoo long.  What this is primarily due to is unclear; maybe an over-developed story with far too much exposition (every character seems to need every other to explain nanomachines\nto them, it seems.  We, however, do not), or perhaps the increasingly egregious and segmented action scenes (why are there spitfires on Mars?  Who knows, let's cut back to Spike\nbeing pursued by military jets for no apparent reason!), or it could be the ponderous attempts to fashion some sort of existential aspect to the story (&amp;quot;I'm not insane,\nthe rest of the world is.&amp;quot; - oh really?  You don't look thirteen years old, Vincent, but you sound it).  Philosophical-minded action films are not especially uncommon;\ngood and effective ones are extremely rare.  Suffice it to say that I was surprised and rather disappointed when the apparent climax occured and passed with a good half an hour\nleft on the clock.  As I say, the film hangs almost completely on the main characters.  It would have been unthinkable to not bring the original cast in for this gig too (can't\nspeak for the dub cast, don't know), and they all acquit themselves just as well as they do in the series.  Music, too, such a central part of the series, is again provided by Yoko\nKanno and the Seatbelts; while the styles used in and prominence given to the music may not be to everyone's tastes, the versatility and range Kanno's score covers while still\nretaining a high basic quality standard is nothing short of incredible.  Visually, the quality seems to have been kicked up a notch; the animation of the series was never bad, but\nthe film is sumptuous and extremely well detailed.    However, one of my main bones of contention remains.  The art design is realistic, unapologetically multicultural and sort of\ngrimy, very credible in its way, but under even cursory analysis, it's illogical in the extreme.  Why is Mars covered in early twentieth-century New York-style tenement blocks and\nlabyrinthine Moroccan markets?  Has anyone remembered that it has one third of earth's gravity?  Is there, in fact, any reason for this to be set on Mars at all, other than to tie\nin all these diverse elements?  It's sci-fi doing what sci-fi does most often and least well - making half-baked stuff up to accomodate its ideas, with no thought for maintainance\nof disbelief suspension.  I was never as bowled over by Cowboy Bebop as many people seem to have been.  Overall I liked it, certainly, in fact I thought some of it was absolutely\nexcellent, but other parts I thought were pretty terrible, and it was quickly clear that the series was never going to be &amp;quot;a classic&amp;quot; in my eyes the way it is for\nlots of others.  This was primarily because of its disjointedness and apparent lack of story direction, and the same is true of this film.  Now, after watching it, I'm left with\nthe same &amp;quot;...well, so what?&amp;quot; feeling a significant amount of the series gave me, but because of the length and the negative impact it has, I have comparatively\nmore holes to pick at as well.  Perhaps if you're a real fan, this film has more to offer, but overall, for me, while I'd not actually call it bad, this doesn't reach the already\nkind of saggy standard the series set.",

         "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door was released in Japan on September 1st, 2001. Shinichiro Watanabe stayed on as director, and it was produced this time by not only Sunrise,\nbut also Bandai Visual (famous for their work on the .hack series and Dennou Coil), and Bones (famous for their work on Fullmetal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club). It was\nreleased Stateside by Bandai on August 11th, 2002. It's just a few days before Halloween on Ganymede, a major national holiday, and a terrorist has blown up a tanker filled with a\nbiochemical weapon. The government posts a 300 million Wulongbounty for the terrorist, and the Bebop crew just decides to go after it.  But the more they investigate, the deeper\nthe rabbit hole seems to go...  Yes, to answer any questions ahead of time, this is not a sequel; it takes place between episodes twenty-two and twenty-three.  It's not quite what\nI was expecting, admittedly, but it's still a pretty good plot.  It could've been fit in the series as a two or three part episode, and apparently Wantanabe had wanted to\noriginally, but he couldn't have gotten away with it on TV.  The visuals for this are absolutely beautiful; the animation got an update in the three years since the show had aired,\nand things are definitely smoother than they were in the show.  There's an even more unprecedented amount of detail in this, and it's absolutely beautiful.  Yoko Kanno and the\nSeatbelts came back to do work on the music again, and it's just as awesome and catchy as it was in the series.  I found myself humming a few of the songs after it was done.  All\nthe seiyuu and the voice actors were able to return for the movie, which just adds t o the awesomeness of the movie in general.  And the dub for this was actually fairly accurate,\nwhich surprises me, as this was released Stateside a little over a year after 9/11, and a few days before the 9/11 attacks over in Japan.  All in all, a pretty good movie, with a\ngood plot and unprecedented detail and smoother animation, if not what I was expecting.",

I suggest that if youre planning to watch Cowboy Bebop – Knockin on Heavens Door, you should watch after you get to\nthe episode when Ed is introduced. You just need to get to know all 4 major characters to understand the movie. I didnt like it as much as the series, mostly because the series\nkept me interested by introducing new plot lines in each episode. Having to focus on one specific plot for 120 minutes was a bit exhausting. It has a nice plot – throughout the\nmovie youll get why Knockin onHeavens Door is part of the title. I also found the plot to be timely. Terrorism is a problem thats been widespread throughout the world for years,\nand its interesting to see a group of bounty hunters trying to do something good for mankind.  The characters are back, of course. Theyre still the same as they were in the series.\n2 more major characters are introduced throughout the movie. The villain is Vincent Volaju, a mysterious terrorist with a forgotten past. He is definitely convincing as a villain,\nat least I think so. Electra is also a character added to the mix. I didnt really like her, mostly because she looks like a guy, but her presence is important to the story. The\noriginal voice actors are also back to reprise their respective roles. I would have been mad if they changed the voice actors.  I think one of the major innovations in the movie is\nthe visuals. The visuals are 10 times more stunning than in the series, all thanks to the collaboration with BONES studio. I guess it may have something to do with the fact that it\nwas produced in 2001, and 2001 animation definitely improved since 1998. The screenplay was also as great as before.  Yoko Kanno came back to do the music again, but I have to say\nIm a bit disappointed. There were less tracks than there were in the series, and there were a lot of scenes where there was no background music at all. That was a rare occurrence\nin the series. The opening theme, \"Ask DNA\" by The Seatbelts featuring Raju Ramayya and the ending theme \"Gotta Knock a Little Harder\" by The Seatbelts featuring Mai Yamane, were\nreally nicely done though.  Obviously, I liked the series better, but that may have something to do with the fact that I finished the series first before watching the movie. Its\nkind of hard to top the ending of the series, so its best if you watch the movie in between the series.",

         "Warning : minor spoilers ahead It was a month ago when I finished cowboy bebop series, and i would say that i was a little bit disappointed. Why would I be disappointed? Well,\nmostly because many episodes almost feel like fillers, they don't support character development and some enemies just minor criminals/bounties and those villains rarely have\ninteresting characters. After sometime, I decided to watch the CB movie. And I would say the movie was very good. This movie has the elements that some cowboy bebop episodes lack.\nMostly the well developed story and characters(villains). Story (8/10) \"Which one is dream? Which one is reality? A 'deadman', searchingfor that answer, tries to endanger the\nsociety. It is up to Spike and the gang to stop him\". Yup, that was pretty much the synopsis of the movie. Like the series, the story presents a sci-fi modern era where humans has\nlived in other planets. Our MCs (Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed), are bounty hunters. This time, they are trying to catch an unknown terrorist. Unlike the series, which lack episodic story\ndevelopment because they have only 20 minutes duration for one story, the movie has almost 2 hours duration. It really has a great difference to tell a story. The story plot is\nvery well chronologically executed, and not rushed. We got to see a complex investigation, gaining information, interesting background story and past of the main villain, good\naction scenes, and a nice final conclusion of all of them. The big differences i felt most with the series are this movie presents us a nice built villains, well developed plot,\nbigger case and conflicts that put our MCs in critical situation, which rarely seen in the series.  Art (9/10) Considering the time it was aired, I would say the animations are\ngreat. The backgrounds are nice and the movements were fluid. But what I like most is the character design. It was unique in my opinion, no moe, and it gives me more mature\natmosphere from it.  Sound (8/10) The sountrack is like the original series, the classic ones. Nice OP and ED. Soundtracks also fit well with the atmosphere of the scenes. Though a\nfew scenes were quiet and don't have BGM in it. Voice acting is also good.  Character (8/10) We got our MCs back, Spike and the gang, whose characters are the same with the series.\nSpike being a cool badass, Faye being selfish and ignorant, Jet who is sometimes being the most sane one, and Ed is.. crazy..  What really caught my attentions was the main\nvillain's character, Vincent. A man with an interesting past that leads to his interesting philosophy (which one is dream, which one is reality). To seek his answes he will do\nanything. Interesting terrorism, which he also left mystery to be solved. Above all that, he also really got some skills to overpower the main protagonist.   Enjoyment (8/10) Yeah,\nlet's make this one short. From the scores above I'd say I really enjoy this movie. It was a nice watch and it has cured my disappointment of CB franchise.  Overall (8/10) Cause\nthe majority of above scores  i gave were 8s, then my overall score would be 8, which means really good.",

Now,\nyou might think this series is an action-packed series with spectacular graphics and compelling story line. Yes, it has spectacular graphics. Yes, it's action-packed. But if\nthere's one thing this series doesn't have, it's a good story. The series focused so much on action that plot-building hardly occur in the show. And when they do, they shorten the\nfighting scenes and add fillers. In terms of plot sequences, this anime didn't doa good job.  To make up for that, however, it had characters that stood out more than it should.\nThe side characters in the series were quirky and strong despite not having much to do with the advancement of the story. I also liked how they didn't discriminate/look down on\nfemale characters. Both sexes had equal roles in the story.  To be honest, I didn't enjoy it that much. Sure, there were scenes that really blew my mind. But along the way, I was\njust watching it and asking, \"What the heck is going on right now?\". If you're into anime filled with action, then I recommend this title. But really, it's just an anime about\ntattoos containing powers and stuff.",

         "Please note this review covers both TV seasons of the Black Lagoon anime. The anime is set within the crime-infested harbor city of Ronapour in Thailand with the series mainly\nfocused on the mercenary/ pirate group known as Lagoon Company, who are hired by the many criminal organizations of the city to smuggle, transport, and acquire items. Black Lagoon\nstrikes up a nice balance of gritty action, black comedy, and drama dabbling into the various missions and criminals that make up the crime-infested world of Ronapour. The series\nis divided up into a series of arcs lasting anywhere from 2-6 episodes that involve the members ofLagoon Company taking up a job and getting into some sort of violent conflict with\nother criminals throughout said job. The story arcs either lean more heavily on black comedy and action or mix this up with drama in exploring the developments of how certain\ncharacters got caught up in the world of crime and adopted their world views with their professions.  Lets focus first on the lighter elements of Black Lagoon with its comedy and\naction, though I wouldnt necessarily say said lighter elements make this accessible for wider audiences. It looks like the series took inspiration from American crime-action films\nto depict the world of crime and action scenes portrayed throughout the series. Criminals of various professions and nationalities are depicted throughout the series, and the\nseries occasionally has some fun with dark humor dabbling into said professions and crimes taking place. The series does get quite violent and sexually-charged at points throughout\nits run with morally-questionable characters, which wont make this good viewing for younger or sensitive audiences as a fair warning. Plus while the animation to the series isnt\ntoo high quality compared to more visually pleasing mid-2000s titles like Eureka 7 or Aria, it still has its moments of creative fight choreography with some of the more over-the-\ntop action scenes such as Robertas weapon stash and feats or Ginjis cutting of bullets.  For the drama piece of things, the series mostly makes use of Rock to explore how the\nresidents of Ronapour and other characters encountered throughout Black Lagoon got involved in the world of crime and came to the rationales they carried with their experiences. He\nserves as sort of a moral center for many of the relevant characters in the series to balance out the more darker elements of the criminal underworld in Ronapour and brings some\nlight to an otherwise apathetic world that the lifestyle brings. The series does have its effective moments with showing Rocks influence on things with affecting Revy in subtle\nways for later episodes compared to how their relationships portrayed in earlier episodes and the Fujiyama Gangstas Paradise arc offers some interesting developments with Rocks\ncharacter coming to grips with his life between Ronapour and Japan. Outside Rock, major characters in the series such as Balalaika and Revy do have their characters explored to\nshow the dark pasts they experienced and what led them to their present life of crime within Ronapour. This does show that outside the shows gritty action and black comedy, there\nis a good deal of depth put into exploring the pasts and mentalities of a number of the characters in how they regard their criminal activity.  In short, Black Lagoon offers up a\nnice mix of spectacle and storytelling with exploring how the members of Lagoon Company handle their criminal lifestyle and the baggage that comes with it within Ronapour. Fans of\ncrime-action inspired from American crime films should be entertained with checking out this gritty title from studio Madhouse.",

         "This one's a little tricky for me to think about. On the surface, Nabari no Ou is yet another ninja action series involving a teen caught in the center of the heavy conflicts\nbetween clans. Many of the characters follow stock archetypes typical of action anime like this such as the sensei, the avenger, the mysterious evil power within the lead and an\nevil baddie and his cohorts wanting to rule the world. Some of them do grow out of these archetypes as the series progresses, though others and certain elements of the series don't\nget much in the way of fleshing out such asthe evil power within Miharu and the motives of Fuuma. The plot's pretty typical as Miharu tries making sense of his personal desires and\nthe power within him as he encounters more folk among the Nabari world. Also, the animation isn't really impressive here with noticeable shortcuts, washed out backgrounds and\nplain-looking character designs.  Ultimately what did lead me to care for the series was the bond that later develops with Miharu and Yoite as both share in the fact they are\ntragic figures caught up in circumstances beyond their control and rely on one another for emotional/ mental stability and support as the series presses on. Both do wind up leading\none another to change their present outlooks on living with Miharu becoming less apathetic and Yoite slowly breaking off from his clan. I suppose this is kind of similar to how\nMarlene and Yuji's relationship affected my thoughts on Blue Gender. Without the character dynamics involved with the main pairings for Blue Gender and Nabari no Ou, both titles\nwould be lacking a major hook to keep me engaged for the remainder of their runs due to how cliched they are otherwise without focusing on them.  Overall, I suppose my thoughts of\nthis series are mixed. It's mostly subpar in premise and presentation, though the major focus on Yoite and Miharu's bond kept me engaged enough to the series for the entirety of\nits run. Your mileage may vary with this one.",

         "With my own high school experience in mind, and after watching a few other high-school set anime like Azumanga Daioh or Cromartie High School, I decided to give Danshi Koukousei no\nNichijou a shot. I needed something that was slapstick and simple, with no complicated plot in my anime diet and it successfully managed to satisfy that hunger. It's exactly what\nthe title depicts: daily life as a high school boy. It involves three high school friends who go to an all boy's high school and their wacky encounters in life. While some of their\nantics are typical to boys, such as stealing panties andplaying RPGs, the way they handle situations is what makes it hilarious. Sometimes the gags itself aren't that funny, but\nthe characters are the ones that make up for it.  They have their own sarcastic , geeky, troubled, obnoxious, calculated personalities that add to the humor.  Oh, and there are\ngirls... but heh, they are a handful on their own and not your average cliched high school girls...  The animation is average, but in this type of comedy anime, animation seems\nirrelevant to me at least, as long as the characters look relatively human and proportioned, I'm good.   It is a typical school comedy anime that will be shelved with others of its\nkind. Yet, there is something about this show's parodies and sense of humor that makes it a bit different than the average anime comedy. Or maybe I acted too much like these high\nschool boys in high school that I actually find them relatable (I hope not. I wasn't THAT ridiculous. At least I don't think so). So, if you need something to watch after a long\nstressful day, or want to take a waltz down memory lane give it a shot,worst case, you ended up laughing.",

         "Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a romantic comedy focused on two student council members of a prestigious and elite high school, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya, having romantic\ninterest in one another. However, both are too prideful to want to confess their feelings to one another and are in a battle of wits to try getting one another to confess their\nlove with the first to confess being the loser of their battle. Kaguya-samas episodes are formatted as such where there are 2-4 separate segments within each episode that revolve\naround either Miyuki and Kaguyas battle of wits to get one another to confess or eachcharacter interacting with family and friends. The series is meant to poke fun of typical\ncliches of the rom-com genre that involve the budding relationships between classmates, as Miyuki and Kaguya attempt to force the other into a confession or manipulate the other\ninto having things go their way for a specific scenario that would typically advance their relationship in a typical romance anime. In these instances, outcomes of the battle of\nwits vary from one of our two leads getting a victory or a draw resulting from some sort of inconvenience that includes the personal flaws and quirks of both leads or the cheerful\nstudent council treasurer Chika unwittingly meddling into the battle between our two leads.  To prevent the format from getting repetitive or monotonous, the segments also include\ninstances where one of our two lead characters interact with members of their family or other classmates. Much like the confession war segments between Miyuki and Kaguya, many of\nthe characters that the leads interact with have their own comical quirks that serve to inconvenience or befuddle the lead characters to some extent. For the most part, the\ncharacters have enough dimension to their personalities where they dont fully fall under a character type, though they dont necessarily develop at all throughout Kaguya-samas run\nas the series is more focused on the comical interactions between the cast than any serious developments with them. So anyone expecting our main couples relationship to develop at\nall throughout Kaguya-samas run may be disappointed to find that the show goes nowhere at advancing it.  Much like other comedy titles of its ilk, you can either like or dislike\nhow it delivers its humor and how well you warm up to the characters. While I do applaud the series for having a premise that breaks the typical mold you would find out of many\nschool comedies that have over-relied on familiar story structures in recent years, I must sadly admit that I was rather indifferent to much of the comedy delivered throughout\nKaguya-samas run. It is still largely dependent on the typical tropes of high school comedies to carry its humor and I didnt really find myself connecting with any of the\ncharacters since there still wasnt enough dimension to them where I could identify with them to any degree beyond whatever character types they personify. Also, I found the\nnarration used for Kaguya-samas comedy to be rather obnoxious at many points throughout the series as it seemed the narrator was trying too hard to hammer on the comedy in Miyuki\nand Kaguyas conflict.  Overall in spite of the shows fanfare, I just didnt care much for what Kaguya-sama: Love is War offered with its comedy in spite of its premise sticking out\nfrom recent premises and episode structures of high school anime comedies. I found I was more receptive to the high school rom-com parody offered up from School Rumble nearly 15\nyears earlier, which is a bit more manic and exaggerated in its comedy compared to Kaguya-sama. If Kaguya-samas style of comedy isnt your cup of tea yet you are still craving for a\nparody of high school rom-coms, Id say give School Rumble a shot instead.",

         "A prison gay review of Prison School Prison School is a comedy about a group of 5 boys who attempt to peek on the girl's changing rooms in their school, but after being caught by\nthe Gestapo-esque Underground Student Council, are subjected to imprisonment inside of the school's grounds. Herein, the main characters attempt to survive the brutality of the\nUSC, as they conspire against the boys, trying to expel them. Prison School is an extremely ecchi anime, on par with actual hentai, and it is completely unapologetic on this front.\nNot only is the fanservice omnipresent (with the USC's vice president more or less servingentirely this role, whose breast size probably set a world record), but, the characters\nroutinely experience severe punishment for their misdeeds, which is a great pleasure for someone with a reverse ryona fetish, such as myself.  As a comedy, Prison School's main\nentertainment value lies in its ability to be comedic. The writing is well-done, but where Prison School really shines is with its characters. While the main character, Kiyoshi is\nrelatively 'normal', others, such as the masochistic Andre, Joe, who has a loving for ants, and Gakuto, my personal favourite of the series, an otaku with a strong interest in the\nThree Kingdoms (a historical period when China was separated into three kingdoms, as the name implies) with very strong leadership abilities, strategies, and an overall strong\ncharacter, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. Additionally, his voice actor did an excellent job, and captured his character greatly.  The storyline of Prison School can\nbe summarised in a few sentences, as I did earlier in this review, even, but the episode by episode happenings are far from predictable. Each episode is varied and the exploits of\nthe pentagonists are all a pleasure to view. This writing is particularly good for a comedy anime.  Overall, Prison School is a well-made anime. It's not one of the greatest\ncomedies ever written, and some may find it hard to look past the raunchy nature of it, but if you can, you're in for one of the best balances of story, comedy and characters I've\nseen in an anime of this genre for quite some time.",

         "If you're looking for a documentary to sate your curiosity about the obscure phenomenon of rumbling schools, look elsewhere. Unfortunately, School Rumble is NOT a show about a\nschool that rumbles. Thankfully, it's a damn good romantic comedy that's actually funny! Don't let the word \"romantic\" fool you into thinking that it'll be anything like Clannad or\nChu2 either. There's no annoying melodrama to be found anywhere, no teenage angst to put a damper on your good mood, or any of that bullshit. There's also no overarching story that\nforces you to sit through every episode either. This is the kind of show that youcan sit down and enjoy with your friends whilst laughing your asses off and eating some pizza (even\nif they're not into anime), and that's the kind of show I just love to watch!  In terms of story, School Rumble is the anime equivalent of a late-90s Cartoon Network show like\nDexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Ed, Edd n Eddy, or The Powerpuff Girls: there's no overarching plot, it's mostly episodic, and nothing of significance happens by the time the\nseason's over. Whereas most romantic comedies to come out in recent years focus more on the romance, School Rumble just tries to make you laugh and if my results are anything to go\nby, I'm sure you'll get more than just a quiet chuckle every now and then. Then again, comedy is purely subjective and I know damn well there some popular comedies that failed to\nmake me laugh even once (cough cough The Big Bang Theory cough cough) but let's not open up that can of worms right now.  Keeping in line with that late-90s Cartoon Network comedy\nfeel, every episode of School Rumble is told in three 7-minute long segments that have next-to-nothing to do with each other. Each segment tackles a simple dilemma that one (or\nboth) of our airheads in love will have to put up with like Harima trying to sit next to Tenma during the school field trip or Tenma trying to sketch Kurasama during art class. I\ncan safely say that this approach worked incredibly well to School Rumble's favour. The concept of each segment is incredibly simple, which makes room for a lot of jokes to be told\nand the segment's just short enough to prevent that concept from getting stale and repetitive. Another upside to this is the fact that you don't have to sit through the entire\nepisode either. I mean, I like to watch segments from episodes of School Rumble on my phone when I'm on the bus to class and by the time the segment's over, the bus is already at\nthe college.  Really, the only complaint I have with the show is that I can't really sit down and watch more than 1-2 whole episodes at a time but that's basically the way I am\nwith comedy shows in general. Whilst I have no problem with comedy, I enjoy shows that have much more to offer than the comedy alone. If I was given the choice to watch an episode\nof GTO or an episode of School Rumble, I'd probably go with the former since GTO has a lot more to it than just the comedy. But then again, everyone's different so maybe you might\nbe the kind of person who can just sit down and marathon 12 episodes in one sitting.  If you're expecting multi-faceted individuals that parallel the kind of questionable morality\nthat real humans tend to have, look elsewhere. School Rumble's characters aren't compelling individuals in the slightest, nor do they undergo any significant change throughout the\ncourse of the series. You know what? That's okay! I mean, Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, and The Powerpuff Girls had static characters and yet people love the everliving Christ\nout of those shows. This doesn't mean that the characters in School Rumble are terrible. In fact, they're far from it. Tenma and Harima are quite possibly some of the most\nendearing and hilarious airheads in all of comedy anime. If School Rumble ever took itself a little more seriously, you'd bet your sweet ass I'd be shipping the hell out of those\ntwo (oh fuck it, I still do!). All of the supporting characters play off of Tenma and Harima exceptionally well too. I never get tired of Tenma's friends and their reactions to her\nlatest scheme to end up with Kurasama. Speaking of Kurasama... there isn't much I really can say about him except he reminds me of Octavius Rex from that episode of Spongebob where\nSpongebob takes Pearl to prom.  There isn't a lot I can really say about School Rumble beyond the fact that it's funny. I mean, the jokes are well-timed and they actually work, the\nEnglish dub is some of Funimation's best work to date (especially given that we have amazing voice actors like Her Highness Lucy Christian as Tenma and Brandon Potter as Harima),\nbut that's basically it. Sure, I can go on and talk about the artwork, the animation, and the soundtrack but I'm pretty sure most people don't go into a comedy show for the\npinnacle of audio-visual quality.   Overall, I give School Rumble an 8/10. It's not the epitome of comedy gold like Gintama apparently is, but it's still pretty damn funny! If\nyou're in the mood for a comedy show that you can watch with your friends and have a damn good time watching it, this show fits the bill and then some. I mean, you don't even need\nto know anything about Japanese culture to even understand the jokes in the first place and there isn't much in the way of fan service or juvenile humour at that. This is something\nyou can actually watch with your family provided that they're willing to give it a shot. Unless you have some sort of long-standing visceral hatred of romantic comedies (or\ncomedies in general), there's no reason why you shouldn't give this show a chance. Anyway, that's it for this review. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n***  Since I haven't done any alternate recommendations in a while, here are a few shows you should check out if you're in the mood for something like School Rumble: - Ouran HSHC\n(the English dub is some really hilarious stuff) - Azumanga Daioh (the quintessential slice-of-life comedy) - Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu (another hilarious slice-of-life comedy with\nLuci Christian as the leading lady) - Great Teacher Onizuka (much more crass and vulgar than School Rumble, but every bit as hilarious. Plenty of sweet and heartwarming moments to\ngo around and hey, it actually has character development! Steve Blum was even cast as Onizuka, what's not to like?!)",

Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year, is on a quest to confess her feelings to the boy she likes. Kenji Harima, a delinquent with a sizable reputation, is in a similar situation, as he cannot properly convey his feelings to the one he loves. Between school, friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight. School Rumble is a high-octane romantic comedy full of relatable situations, as Tenma and Kenji both try to win the hearts of those they desire."

But her homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki, is the kind of person who would hijack a student's bike to avoid being late, so \"strange\" is a relative word. There certainly isn't a shortage of peculiar girls in Yukari-sensei's homeroom class. Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo's best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats. In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls—and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo's pigtails! Together, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school."

With the only other club member being the beautiful ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita, Hachiman finds himself on the front line of other people's problems—a place he never dreamed he would be. As Hachiman and Yukino use their wits to solve many students' problems, will Hachiman's rotten view of society prove to be a hindrance or a tool he can use to his advantage?"

         "ocated on the outskirts of Tokyo, Hachimitsu Private Academy is a prestigious all-girls boarding school, famous for its high-quality education and disciplined students. However, this is all about to change due to the revision of the school's most iconic policy, as boys are now able to enroll as well. At the start of the first semester under this new decree, a mere five boys have been accepted, effectively splitting the student body into a ratio of two hundred girls to one boy. Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Andre, and Jo are quickly cast away without having a chance to make any kind of a first impression. Unable to communicate with their fellow female students, the eager boys set their sights on a far more dangerous task: peeping into the girls' bath! It's only after their plan is thoroughly decimated by the infamous Underground Student Council that the motley crew find their freedom abruptly taken from them, as they are thrown into the school's prison with the sentence of an entire month as punishment. Thus begins the tale of the boys' harsh lives in Prison School, a righteous struggle that will ultimately test the bonds of friendship and perverted brotherhood."

Ranked the top student in the nation and respected by peers and mentors alike, Miyuki serves as the student council president. Alongside him, the vice president Kaguya—eldest daughter of the wealthy Shinomiya family—excels in every field imaginable. They are the envy of the entire student body, regarded as the perfect couple. However, despite both having already developed feelings for the other, neither are willing to admit them. The first to confess loses, will be looked down upon, and will be considered the lesser. With their honor and pride at stake, Miyuki and Kaguya are both equally determined to be the one to emerge victorious on the battlefield of love!"

The cast plays a sport, it may not be a real life sport but for\ntheir world, it is. Instead of a guys team, it's a girl's team. Instead of a girl manager, its a guy manager. There is the fresh year who joins the club and turns into the ace in\nthe hole. Actually though, look at Haiykuu or Kuroko. They have all what was mentioned before, but the opposite gender.And being a fan of those two recent sports animes, I had a\ngood time watching this one.  Some may call out our MC is quite the dumb klutz, but she is about as clueless to the sport as she was. In short, she learns about the sport as much\nas we do from watching.  The sport is pretty neat, its a 1 versus 1 aerial battle for point control. One player tries to get from one area to another, while the other tries to stop\nthem.  It's not such an intense watch as the more well known sports animes, but it certainly isn't what the tags say it is. Check it out for a more lighter and chill sport anime.",

Obviously, the show is not targeted toward\nthe hockey community and more towards introducing Japan to a sport that is not too big. Still, the show is a very unrealistic portrayal of the sport and doesn't represent the sport\nat all. I can keep spewing but mostly to sum it up you have a team of beginner players with their own rink, personal pro shop, and facilities with only a roster of 5 skaters and a\ngoalie, theteam is named Dream Monkeys, and their main selling point to performing victory dances every time they win.  Other than their portrayal of the basis and rules of the\ngame this anime fails to show what the sport is truly like and if the intent is to push popularity toward the sport many people are gonna be disappointed if they think this show\nrepresents the true sport.  TLDR: JAPAN BEATS TEAM CANADA WTF If you think this is a actual hockey anime don't waste your time",

         "If you wanted your Haikyuu!! fix after finishing this and don't care about the sport it takes place in, then boy do I have the anime for you!. Join a young boy who loves the sport\nhe plays in so much but is often looked down by other players because of his smaller physique. Little do they know though, that this young boy has so much more to offer than what\nmeets the eye. Follow his journey as he meets a prodigy joining in his same year and watch as they go from rivals to linked teammates that form the core of the team's\noffensivepower! Let's not forget about the other character too! Meet the second years, who lost in a previous tournament and now vow to take the top before losing again but coming\nout stronger in the second tournament with the rest of the newly formed team. Led by the captain, a usually kind person that gets strict when his teammates break the rules or\ndisrespect their seniors, and the coach: someone who comes from a pedigree father who used to play the sport professionally! And don't forget about the teammate who doesn't show up\nfor the first tournament, only to return to fill in the team's much needed defense problem by being a hardworking yet talented defenseman who cares about protecting his team! Join\nthem, as they fight against other teams with ties to certain team members' pasts, as they discover the true meaning of strength on the court and the team aspect that is much needed\nto get there!  This description fits both Haikyuu!! and Kuroko no Basket, they are the same. That doesn't mean they're bad, but honestly the plots are so similar that it's hard not\nto compare them. Not a bad anime, and I think Kuroko's hype moments are far better than Haikyuu!!'s, but I think I prefer Haikyuu!! all the same. No smoke though, still a good\nanime.",

         "Many sports anime come and go over the years, some barely staying in the memory of viewers. However, every so often, something appears that grabs viewers' attention and Ao Ashi has\nachieved that this Spring 2022 season. Ao Ashi frames itself as kind of a rags to riches story. Ashito Aoi is clearly talented; he and everyone around him know that much. However,\nhe has to climb more obstacles than most due to his familial situation, competing against people who stand in the way of his road to success. Many sports anime dramatise the sport\nitself while simplifying everything else around the players and teams, while Ao Ashiwas totally relatable and realistic.  Coming to the technical aspects, the OST was sane and the\nanimation by Production I.G (the studio behind other sports anime like Haikyuu, Run With The Wind, Kuroko No Basket) was clean and was consistent. Compared to other works by the\nsame studio, Ao Ashi felt bit behind in terms of excitement or relativity, however it was effective enough to deliver it's story against the backdrop of a protagonist who is trying\nto make his mark (I relate it to Diamond No Ace, which I also rated the same). It might be the top sports anime, but I will hold my horses for Blue Lock, since it involves the same\nsport.  My Rating : 7.5/10",

         "Kabaddi is a contact team sport which involves no material equipment but the human body to play. It is the national sport of Bangladesh, the country where I'm from and has\nhistorical origins in Ancient India, particularly in Tamil Nadu around 4000 years ago. Legend says that even Gautam Buddha enjoyed playing this game. Of all sports known globally,\nKabaddi was a sport I never imagined to get an anime adaption, so kudos to the mangaka, Hajime Musashino, for introducing this rather unknown sport to Otakus and making it look\ncool. All the characters were enjoyable to watch, even the opponent and side characters. The animation was prettygood. It was not impressive to some others but I will let it pass.\nMaybe I am biased, but I played it as a kid and felt a rather historical-cultural connection about an anime that talked about a unpopular sport that is still simple and accessible;\nso I didn't mind the intricacies much. Rather I was more surprised that it even tried to feed a good plot, a good story with emotional value with the usual tropes you see in other\nsports anime.  This anime sadly flew under the radar because everyone else has preferences of trashy tropes and not try something out of the unknown; I mean, the anime did a good\njob in introducing the sport to its viewers for the first few episodes who may be unfamiliar with it.  This is the type of anime you would wish had more than 12 episodes. In\nBangladesh, we call it 'Ha-du-du'. Kabaddi also has a World Cup for both men's and women's teams organized by the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). Look it up.",

At Seirin High School, two newly recruited freshmen prove that they are not ordinary basketball players: Taiga Kagami, a promising player returning from the US, and Tetsuya Kuroko, a seemingly ordinary student whose lack of presence allows him to move around unnoticed.

To reach their goal, they have to cross pathways with several powerful teams, some of which have one of the five players with godlike abilities, whom Kuroko and Taiga make a pact to defeat."

This show takes place between the games trails of cold steel\n2 and 3, in another country. The cool thing about the trails world is that it's very much living and breathing. We follow a soldier girl on a secret mission to find out who an\nopposing empire's secret hero weapon is (The protagonist of the cold steel games.) For me it's great because I get to see another perspective of the world, and its politics, and\nnot like the dumb Americanpolitics. I just don't know how enjoyable it would be to someone who hasn't played the game and doesn't know some of the context. There is a ton of\nreferences, and every town they visit that is in the game look just like the game. I'm gonna give it 8/10 honestly. I wish they would just do an anime for trails of the sky though\nand go all the way to the newest game. I liked that this exists, and it's new content, but I know a lot of people won't play 500 plus hours of a jrpg I'd like to see more people\nget invested in it cause in trails of cold steel 4 It's amazing to see all the protagonist from other games come together.",

         "Arknights : Prelude to dawn is an anime adaptation of a game with the same name. 1- The story of Arknights takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a disease has infected some\npeople causing them to slowly die and infect others after death. The infected people are discriminated against by the non-infected governments which causes a group of infected\ncalled reunion to become terrorists. The main characters are a group called rhodes island which are made up of infected people working for a world in which the infected and non-\ninfected can coexist in peace. If we ignore the game and look at the anime asa separate project, the story is well written and developed. The world and characters were introduced\nproperly and in overall the anime was interesting and amusing.   2- The animation style was (for me) interesting. The background was well drawn and the characters were ell\ndesigned, however the anime was lacking in fight scenes (probably due to limited budget). My score for animation will be 7/10.  3- Although i haven't been playing the game for a\nlong time,I found that the anime has captured the feelings of the game creators. The characters were well developed and the world was built based on in-game designs. Many people\nhave found that the anime was rushed and didn't give the characters the time and attention they needed that was probably due to the game length (8 episodes which took me a day to\nfinish equals to 3 chapters in-game which took a month to finish). As a new player i cannot give a professional opinion however in my experience watching anime Arknights : Prelude\nto dawn was not rushed.  4- I haven't watched many anime game adaptations however Arknights anime was made to be enjoyed by game and non-game players alike. Creating an anime based\non a game is harder than based on a manga however Arknights captured the game story and game play in a way that many other manga adaptations weren't able to. A non game player can\nwatch the anime and understand the game and love the characters without playing the game.  My overall Rating for Arknights is 8/10. This is because the people who made this anime\nmade it for all people not only the ones who played the game. It was made with love and dedication for the game world and characters.",

By day, it is a normal school, educating its pupils in history, languages, and the like. But at night, it turns into a gambling den, educating them in the art of dealing with money and manipulating people. Money is power; those who come out on top in the games stand at the top of the school. Yumeko Jabami, a seemingly naive and beautiful transfer student, is ready to try her hand at Hyakkaou's special curriculum.

Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard. This doesn't end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour. These skills, along with the incredibly powerful items she obtains, allow her to obliterate most enemies in a single hit. After only a few days of playing the game, Maple claims third place in a server-wide event, gaining a reputation as a player who is both unkillable and absurdly powerful. Despite her overpowered character, Kaede has much to learn. As she progresses through the game, she meets new friends and acquaintances, helping her complete new levels and events.

Large veins of Originium can naturally be found at the sites of Catastrophes, various forms of natural disasters caused by the mineral itself.\n\nHowever, the usage of Originium comes at a price, as there is a high risk of getting infected with Oripathy—an incurable and highly contagious disease.

It's extremely fun, and the colors, sounds, and characters are all enjoyable, even if the story is just off the\nwall unusual. Classicaloids is, in short, about the clones? Reborn versions? Of classical composers like Mozart, Chopin, Schubert, ect. Living in the modern era with their\ncreators(?) daughter in a huge mansion. They are all bubbly, fun, colorful, and completely different from one another, finding their happiness in daily life while also occasionally\nturning into classical music-themed magical girls and boys.

         "Its been a while since Ive watched anime. Ok, thats not entirely true. (I watched Salarymans club a couple of months ago, and it was the most average/ formulaic anime that Ive ever\nseen). Its been a while since Ive seen good anime. Is Sk good or bad? I dont think I can answer that with a simple yes or no. The show has an interesting premise; its about fun.\nWhat does that mean? How can a show be about fun? I think thats a great question. And I hope that by writing this review I get a little closer to understanding that question. Whats\nthe plot?Well, uh Theres this downhill, S-shaped, offroadish skate track, and people race on it. Theres a little more to it, but that is mostly it.   Can skateboarding down the\nsame exact course over and over again be fun? Surprisingly yes. In fact, other than when Reki and Langa are just aimlessly skating around town, its the only time the show is fun.\nNot only is the plot not memorable, generally none of the characters are either. Except Adam. When Adam is on screen the show is fun.  Whether hes making a surprise, acrobatic,\npyrotechnic grand entrance welcoming bitches, and bros, and non-binary hoes, or doing some hypnotizing tapdance / ballet hybrid while slaloming at the speed of light I couldnt look\naway. I was totally captivated by Adam. And while he has a seemingly endless number of completely absurd antics up his sleeve, he doesnt need to continuously go bigger to be\ncompelling. Adam is compelling just standing there. He can stand in front of a TV screen, or tenderly smoke a cigarette while   The show has flashes of brilliance: I cant think of\nmany more shows where Ive had more, intense bursts of fun. But for whatever reason, the show just cant put it all together; for every impressive feat, theres a baffling writing/\ndirectorial choice.  Why is there a C-plot about Adam having a Bruce Wayne type alter ego who is embroiled in a corruption scandal?

Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime. They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way."

         "Fumizuki Academy isn't a typical Japanese high school. This unique institution has implemented a new and innovative system to sort its students. At the end of their freshman year, students take a test that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed into A class, all the way down until F class, for the lowest of the low. Unfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii, his supposedly \"great\" intellect wasn't quite enough for such a test, and he's now stuck at the bottom of F class. Naturally, F class has the worst facilities: not only rotten tatami mats and broken tables, but also outdated equipment and worn out furniture. On the bright side, his friend Yuuji Sakamoto is in the same class, and to everyone's surprise, the genius girl Mizuki Himeji has also ended up in the same class due to an unforeseen fever on the day of the test. Unsatisfied with their perquisites, F class rallies behind Yuuji, determined to take on the higher-tiered classes in order to seize their perks by using the school's Examinations Summon Battle system. The participants can summon fantasy characters—whose power levels are equal to their student's test scores—in an all-out battle. Will F class be able to rise to the top, or will they live up to everyone's expectations and fail?"

Miyako had many chances to do ANYTHING to this girls yet she just played\nand messed around with them instead of sexually harassing them.

Unable to play an instrument, she decides to visit to apologize and quit. Meanwhile, the Light Music Club faces disbandment due to a lack of members. This causes the club members to offer anything, from food to slacking off during club time, in order to convince Yui to join. Despite their efforts, Yui insists on leaving due to her lack of musical experience. As a last resort, they play a piece for Yui, which sparks her fiery passion and finally convinces her to join the club. From then onward, it's just plain messing around with bits and pieces of practice. The members of the Light Music Club are ready to make their time together a delightful one!"

During the duo's first year, Yui and Kyouko formed the \"Amusement Club\" which occupies the now nonexistent Tea Club's room. Shortly after Akari joins, one of her fellow classmates, Chinatsu Yoshikawa, pays the trio a visit under the impression that they are the Tea Club; it is only once the three girls explain that the Tea Club has been disbanded that they can convince Chinatsu to join the Amusement Club—a group with no purpose other than to provide entertainment for its members. Based on the slice-of-life manga by Namori, Yuru Yuri is an eccentric comedy about a group of girls who spend their spare time drinking tea and fawning over each other, all while completely failing to even notice the supposed main character Akari amongst them."

However, what starts off as one of Rin's usual camping sessions somehow ends up as a surprise get-together for two when the lost Nadeshiko Kagamihara is forced to take refuge at her campsite. Originally intending to see the picturesque view of Mount Fuji for herself, Nadeshiko's plans are disrupted when she ends up falling asleep partway to her destination. Alone and with no other choice, she seeks help from the only other person nearby. Despite their hasty introductions, the two girls nevertheless enjoy the chilly night together, eating ramen and conversing while the campfire keeps them warm.

While Yuzu's eagerness initially proves to be more of a hindrance than a blessing, her playful nature brings a unique charm to the inn, as both customers and her fellow workers quickly warm up to her clumsy yet well-meaning mistakes. Under the guidance of the other foxes—the rigid Satsuki, the carefree Natsume, the critical Ren, and the quiet Sakura—Yuzu steadily learns the trade of an inn attendant while learning to love the magical world surrounding her.

         "Dead Leaves....... How can I even describe this anime? It's animated by Production I.G., it's directed by the same guy who directed Gurren Lagann and FLCL, and it's is the weirdest\nfucking thing I have ever seen in my life. This is an anime that goes for all style, no substance but it amps it up with so much stuff thrown at you that it is impossible to call\nit that. The easiest way to describe Dead Leaves is this: IT\"S ANIME ON CRACK. The plot of Dead Leaves goes like this: Two people wake up naked on Earth with no recollection of\ntheir memories. Oneis named Retro, the one with the TV screen as a head, and the other is named Pandy because she has a eye that makes her look like a panda. After they wake up,\nthey decide to go steal some clothes, rob food, clothes and weapons, have an orgasmic epic action chase scene with the ENTIRE police force and later on, they get captured and\nsentenced to die on a prison that takes place on the moon, which looks like it's been eating in half. Together with a bunch of other prisoners, they team up to escape from this\nprison by blowing shit-up with style and kicking ass. This is the best way I could describe the plot for Dead Leaves because honestly, there isn't one.  Dead Leaves is all about\nover the top action with a lot of exploding colorful visuals. Seriously, If you're gonna watch Dead Leaves, then don't expect a plot or any kind of character development cause Dead\nLeaves has none of that and when it does, it falls flat on it's face. But even if it doesn't have any story or character development, Dead Leaves just kicks ass and better than\nother overrated popular action anime like High School Of The Dead, which I found that anime to be incredibly shitty. The action in Dead Leaves is an exploding, ultra-violent thrill\nride that never stops and it is crazy. We're talking about a woman and a guy with a TV set as a head unleashing chaos everywhere, a guy with a drill as his penis who uses it as a\nweapon (don't ask), mechas popping out of nowhere and start shooting at everyone, a baby that is a God and a giant caterpillar that starts destroying the moon base Godzilla style.\nThat's how cool and awesome the action in Dead Leaves is and once you're into the action of this anime, you are gonna be re-watching those scenes for eternity. How about the\ncharacters? Honestly, they are likable. While they don't have a lot of development, they are just cool and each have their own strange but unique charm that's it's impossible to\nhate the characters. They're just damn fun.  The animation by Production I.G. is incredibly good-looking, making GITS look like his bitch in comparison. The style is incredibly\nwith so much over the top creativity in it's visuals and colors alone that it holds very well. The character designs are excellent that range from weird to cool to just downright\ninsanely creepy. I just love Retro's design with the TV screen as a head, which is kinda messed-up but at the same time, it is really creative and the rest of the characters look\ngreat. The music consists of heavy techno but it fits and the soundtrack is fun to listen, as well as the dub by Manga Entertainment. Jaxon Lee and Amanda Winn-Lee were perfect for\nthe roles of Retro and Pandy as their delivery was just perfect and the dialogue is pretty vulgar but somehow come off as hilarious. Simply put, you have to see this with the dub\non.  If you're looking for an anime with some story or development, then Dead Leaves is not for you.

         "I usually never write reviews, but this anime did so many things right that I feel I kind of have to. You just have to get past the sometimes wacky and cartoonish animation style\nand the infinite amount of fanservice and eventually see that the series is so much more than that. After seeing the first couple of episodes I was kind of unsure still and didn't\nquite know what was going on. I was trying to decide whether I like it or not, but from ep 11 onwards I knew I was hooked and from ep 18 till the end it was one crazy,action-packed\ntrip that I wished to never end.   KlK takes its laughable plot, crazy characters, infinite boobs and butts and kick-ass action and rolls it all into a solid, fun and enjoyable\nwatching experience. The story sounds just ridiculous if you try to explain it to someone else, and the battle outfits probably make one roll their eyes, but you have to get sucked\ninto the whole thing and you'll find that in the end you don't even pay attention to it anymore but just want to see how it'll all end. Now, this is something that KlK did just\nright: it took all the cliches and all the fanservice and managed to make it work without boring the viewer and without being too ridiculous. Or should I say, it's all just so over\nthe top and crazy that it actually works.  Most of the characters are likable. (Yes, I'm one of the Mako fans, although I usually hate that type.) The villains are awesome &amp;\nnasty. The music is absolutely fitting for each scene and makes your adrenaline flow. The humor is crazy, as well as the action. Everything works. I have to admit the show starts\noff a little slow but dear god, don't drop this because of that. I think this series deserves a solid 9.",

         "I thought I had seen it all, then I saw Dead Leaves. Preface: From the mind of Hiroyuki Imaishi (director of FLCL and Gurren Lagann) comes this cracktastic adventure of the bizarre\nand insane. Get ready for a 45m long wild ride on ludicrous speed. It goes full plaid. Story: 8 Retro- a guy with a TV for a head, and Pandy- a woman with an enormous red eye wake\nup in the middle of nowhere with no recollection as to how they got there, or what the heck they were doing in the first place. Their inhibitions flung to the wind, they take up\narms andgo buck wild on the city, only to be rounded up and sent to the prison Dead Leaves, which is located on the half munched-off remainder of the moon. Hilarity, violence, and\nmadness ensue.  Art: 10  Everything about this OVA screams Hiroyuki Imaishi. I loved seeing his unique art style on display- Everything in this looked like the bumper slides from\nGurren Lagann for reference, and I thought it was awesome. Crisply animated, and so so so many quick cuts, flashing lights, and fast, fluidly moving action pieces. Vibrant colors,\nand those glorious stars.    Sound: 8  I watched this in sub, and the voice acting was appropriately outrageous and manic. The energetic music pumped along to the explosions,\ngunfire, and general mayhem going onscreen. Great stuff.    Characters: 8  Okay, so, Pandy the Red-eyed asskicking leading lady, and Retro, the deranged TV head team up to figure\nout just exactly what the heck is going on, along with a skeevy doctor that looks like Zoidberg, but swap the tentacles for bad teeth, some dudes with some not-so-subtle\nreproductive organ parts for heads, and Mr. Chinko Drill, who has an enormous golden drill for a penis. That's right, a drill, and he's not afraid to use it.  They all play their\nparts with equal bits psychosis and thirst for violence, and it couldn't be much more entertaining to watch.   Enjoyment: 9   What a rush. Nonstop, quick cut, over the top, sheer\ncraziness from start to finish. It never lets up. Blink, and you might as well be watching something else- it goes FAST. Story on hyperdrive, action on lightspeed- I had to rewind\nseveral times after trying to find my jaw to put it back on. The absurd situations, the crude jokes, loved all of it. Couldn't stop laughing the whole time.   Overall: 8.8\n(rounding this one up, because it was too much fun) - 9  In typical, addictive Imaishi style, it is extremely irreverent, edgy, and a bit crass, but when combined with his\nincredible art, a tasty soundtrack, and more gonzo than you've seen since Inferno Cop, and we have a formula for success.   Note: I see this as a sort of spiritual predecessor to\nGurren Lagann. The art style definitely was inspired by this, and no-one can deny the introduction of the awesomeness of Spiral Power that we have Dead Leaves to thank for.",

         "What with the whole crippling recession thing and the massive black stain currently tainting the south coast, it's easy to imagine corporations as heartless money grubbers\noppressing the common man in order to maintain their all-night drug-fueled yacht parties. A young japanese businessman by the name of Rokuro Okajima finds out the hard truth of\nthese rumors when he is slated for death by his company simply because he found out about their plot to sell nuclear weapons to foreign dictators planning to use them to incinerate\nwide-eyed orphens in the small, undefended nation of Lovey-Dovey-stan. Oh, wait, did I say that he found outabout their plan? What I meant to say was that they told him their plan\nso that they would have an excuse to kill him instead of rescuing him from a group of mercenaries. In the face of this revalation, Rokuro, or \"Rock\" to his captors, decides that\nany life is better than no life and helps the mercenaries escape their pursuers by dreaming up a manuever so outrageously awesome it has to be seen to be believed. And thus begins\nthe adventures of Rock and the Black Lagoon company. The BL company is your standard gallery of rougues: Dutch, the charismatic, slightly insane leader; Benny, the nerdy, brainy\nguy who only does something useful about every five episodes; and Revy, the resident badass who is called upon to do everything that involves making things significantly less\nalive. Together, they accept missions from various parties to deliver things from point A to point B on their torpedo boat, The Black Lagoon. See, calling them mercenaries was a\nbit of a misnomer. They're more like delivery boys. Delivery boys in the sense that Paperboy was a delivery boy, where everything is constantly trying to kill you. And as delivery\nboys, they are pitted against the very dregs of humanity: independent contractors, revolutionary guerillas, nazis, and, worst of all, maids. (Yeah, we know what you're hiding\nunderneath those dresses.) Luckily, they have the implacable Revy on their side to even things out, as she has the approximate net worth of 5,000 kilojoules of awesome behind her.\nSee, Black Lagoon takes place in the same reality as every action movie in existence in that your ability to get hit by bullets is inversely proportional to how awesome you are.\nIt's hard to notice in the earlier episodes with all of the flipping and shit, but five episodes in she isn't even trying anymore. She just calmly dispatches everyone in her path\nwhile enemy bullets clang helplessly against her concentrated cool. Still, for the most part the gun fights are done well and are entertaining to watch. The stories are pretty\ndark, as you may have guessed from the story summary, but what prevents this show from turning into just a group of amoral escapades is Rock himself. He is the ray of light that\nshows that reason can still prevail in the depths of the underworld. But he is also the glimmer of naivety that violence is not the answer. For in the world they live in, violence\nis the standard and diplomacy is the exception. Watching his and Revy's philosophies clash is both amusing and terrifying, for it threatens to unravel your perception of the world\nas you know it. So if you're looking for a psuedo-realistic action show that threatens to eradicate your bubble of safety and logic, Black Lagoon may be just the show for you.  And\nseriously, corporations suck.",

         "Guns are blazing and bodies start to drop like flies left and right. Hollywood action is back in town, it is called Black Lagoon! Black Lagoon is a story that is set in a real\nworld but actual realism is thrown away as expected. It offers nothing but flashy and bloody gunfights. As a fan of action movies and stuff, it is safe to say that this show made a\nfine job in general. My favorite action scene in the anime was in the second episode, where our lovely mercenaries manages to make their boat fly and shoot the enemy helicopter in\nmid-air. That onemade me laugh out loud. I wish there were more ridiculous scenes like that. Also, I'd love to see some more hand-to-hand combat, it is always fun to watch close\ncombat scenes.   When it comes to the story, it is a mixed bag. I like the episodic structure of the show, it suits the non-chalant nature of the anime. It doesn't take itself\nseriously that much most of the time. There is no full-fledged story in here and that's fine. Basically, what happens is our crew have some gigs from various clients and complete\nthem in one or two episodes. The problem is all these small stories kind of feels the same. They don't really stick with you that much. The only one I liked was the one with\nRoberta in it. That one had different dynamics and was fun to watch.   The cast of the show looks quite versatile on surface. All these badass characters with different ethnicites\nmust be fun to watch for sure. However, I think there are some wasted potential in here. Anime focuses on our fun duo, Revy and Rock. Both characters end up in the same shitty\nbusiness but their perspectives are quite the opposite. Their ideals and philosophies clash several times in the show and I appreciate that. We get to know these two fairly enough\nbut that's it. There are more good characters like Balalaika, Benny and my personal favorite Dutch. I personally prefer Balalaika over Revy any day. She's a veteran boss-lady in\nthe business and I'm sure she'd kick Revy's ass when it comes to being a badass. Dutch is also a great character. He's the calm and collected captain of the crew with experience.\nHe prefers diplomacy over violence unlike Revy but when gunfight is inevitable, he's almost skilled as Revy. Also, Dutch is black, it means he is extra cool. The show fails the\nexplore these characters properly unfortunately, it is a missed opportunity without a doubt.   In short, Black Lagoon is a stylish Hollywood-esque action flick with a colorful\ncast. It is a fun experience but it fails to give a lasting impression at the end of the day. There is some wasted potential for sure.",

Following her only lead—the missing half of his invention, the Scissor Blade—she arrives at the prestigious Honnouji Academy, a high school unlike any other. The academy is ruled by the imposing and cold-hearted student council president Satsuki Kiryuuin alongside her powerful underlings, the Elite Four. In the school's brutally competitive hierarchy, Satsuki bestows upon those at the top special clothes called \"Goku Uniforms,\" which grant the wearer unique superhuman abilities. Thoroughly beaten in a fight against one of the students in uniform, Ryuuko retreats to her razed home where she stumbles across Senketsu, a rare and sentient \"Kamui,\" or God Clothes. After coming into contact with Ryuuko's blood, Senketsu awakens, latching onto her and providing her with immense power. Now, armed with Senketsu and the Scissor Blade, Ryuuko makes a stand against the Elite Four, hoping to reach Satsuki and uncover the culprit behind her father's murder once and for all."

         "Years after an ancient evil was salvaged from the depths of the sea, Joutarou Kuujou sits peacefully within a Japanese jail cell. He's committed no crime yet demands he not be released, believing he's been possessed by an evil spirit capable of harming those around him. Concerned for her son, Holly Kuujou asks her father, Joseph Joestar, to convince Joutarou to leave the prison. Joseph informs his grandson that the \"evil spirit\" is in fact something called a \"Stand,\" the physical manifestation of one's fighting spirit which can adopt a variety of deadly forms. After a fiery brawl with Joseph's friend Mohammed Avdol, Joutarou is forced out of his cell and begins learning how to control the power of his Stand. However, when a Stand awakens within Holly and threatens to consume her in 50 days, Joutarou, his grandfather, and their allies must seek out and destroy the immortal vampire responsible for her condition. They must travel halfway across the world to Cairo, Egypt and along the way, do battle with ferocious Stand users set on thwarting them. If Joutarou and his allies fail in their mission, humanity is destined for a grim fate."

         "Nicholas Brown and Worick Arcangelo, known in the city of Ergastalum as the \"Handymen,\" are mercenaries for hire who take on jobs no one else can handle. Contracted by powerful mob syndicates and police alike, the Handymen have to be ready and willing for anything. After completing the order of killing a local pimp, the Handymen add Alex Benedetto—a prostitute also designated for elimination—to their ranks to protect her from forces that want her gone from the decrepit hellhole of a city she has come to call home. However, this criminal’s paradise is undergoing a profound period of change that threatens to corrode the delicate balance of power. Ergastalum was once a safe haven for \"Twilights,\" super-human beings born as the result of a special drug but are now being hunted down by a fierce underground organization. This new threat is rising up to challenge everything the city stands for, and the Handymen will not be able to avoid this coming war."

It's\neasy to be fooled by the style and some of the tone and think this is simply an anime for children. It's not. And by that I don't mean it's a complete trick, the way the opening to\nAsobi Asobase gives you a false impression. A lot of the humor in Shirokuma Cafe is puns and a lot of it (especially in thesecond half of the series) is absurd.  But most of the\ncharacters are adults, so a lot of times episodes revolve around workplaces and adult friendships.  The best example is probably with Shirokuma (who runs the cafe) who has been\nbest friends with Grizzly (who runs a bar) since childhood, and while they have very different personalities you get to see how that developed and how much it means to both of\nthem... neither of whom are great at expressing it directly in words but make it clear in their actions.  At heart it's a show about relationships, with a group of imperfect but\nstill good, well-meaning humans and animals who try to look out for each other.  It's not all warm-fuzzies, though.  A lot of the humor is great.  But it is a lot of puns, a lot of\nabsurd stuff, and a lot goes for \"clever\" or \"well-crafted\" more than slapstick or over-the-top usually.  There's a lot of subtle and understated humor, and I'm sure I'm missing a\nton of stuff and additional nuance that I'd get if I spoke Japanese as well.  It's also definitely one you have to be in the right headspace for, too.  If you're in the mood for\nSaiki-K style humor, this isn't going to fit the bill.",

However, stuck between his grandfather's insistence to become a mechanic like him and the pressure of his deceased father's legacy, the only excitement Renton finds is in his pastime of riding the Trapar wave particles that are dispersed throughout the air, an activity akin to surfing. Everything changes when an unknown object crashes through Renton's garage, discovered to be a Light Finding Operation—a robot capable of riding the Trapar waves—specifically known as the Nirvash typeZERO. Its pilot is a young girl named Eureka, a member of the Gekkostate, who requests a tune-up for the Nirvash.

My problem with Tamako Market however is that unlike really good slice of\nlife series, the characters lives have literally nothing interesting about them and their relationships with each other are nearly non-existent. In better slice of life shows the\ncharacters are doing something interesting (playing in a band for example), have a unique personality or outlook on life, and or have enough chemistry with their companions to\nevoke any amount of emotion from the audience. There's a magical talking bird that's exciting! Butall it does is talk and everyone in the show treats it like it's completely\nnormal, the show taking an insane matrix dive to dodge any kind of intrigue or suspense.  Birdo has his own story line but it's very short and incredibly meaningless.  Whatserface\nMainCharacter-chan is an unremarkable girl leading an unremarkable life.  She lives with her father and sister, she goes to school, she helps out in her community.

A life where food is served right up\nto us, a life where we are allowed to dream, and a life where we will receive help from others if we just asked. This is a sort of life that fits most of our description but for\nDenji, this is something beyond luxury. An other-worldly life and a life that could never be his. Stuck with payments due to the Yakuza after his father passed away, Denji lives a\nlonely, haunting, and depressing life. One wherethere's no guarantee of what tomorrow might bring. A life that cannot give him surety about his next meal or even permission to\ndream like a normal human. Every new day brings its series of challenges and with just one incident, everything changes in Denji's life forever. With Makima entering his life,\nthings get better, or would you say even worse? With a change in job to a proper Devil Hunter to getting his freedom eliminated and becoming mere livestock that fulfills his\npurpose until it drops dead, Denji's new life as the 'Chainsaw Devil' finally begins.  The anime is unique and exciting as it maintains every genre differently &amp; covers itself\nwith huge backstories but also maintains a fast pace forward with its current timeline. Chainsaw Man focuses on the development of characters with brutal reality and shows the\nthings we might expect in the upcoming seasons of it making the anime all the better. And as for the animation, you can say that MAPPA went all out with its budget.  This anime is\nabsolutely a \"MUST WATCH.\"",

He aims to demolish the cafe and convert it into a parking lot, only to discover that his grandmother had taken in five girls prior to her death.\n\nThe girls—Ouka Makuzawa, Akane Hououji, Riho Tsukishima, Shiragiku Ono, and Ami Tsuruga—evidently shared a deep bond with Sachiko, and they naturally refuse to give up the place they call home. They convince Hayato to change his mind, albeit reluctantly. Through this encounter, Hayato eventually remembers his past with his grandmother as well as his love for the cafe.\n\nNow resolved to carry on his grandmother's legacy, Hayato enlists the girls to act as the \"goddesses\" that will ensure the preservation of this precious abode.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

         "At the start of the season I saw a new Idol anime was airing. Another series where i'll watch 3 or 4 episodes, maybe download the rhythm gatcha mobile game. What I actually got was\na show that shows the excitement of being an Idol Fan. Summary: A girl named Eripiyo's world is changed for the better when she walks by a small idol group preforming, there she\nwould meet Maina. Quickly she falls into the dark hole we know as being an intense Idol Fan. From buying out the merch table of Maina CDS to going to every concert, Eripiyo is a\ntrue Idol Fan. Allshe wishs is to see Maina succeed and be happy.  Thus the title \"If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die\"  Story(7.9): Very Slice-of-life,\njust Eripiyo and her fellow idol fans being idol fans. We see the struggles of waiting in the hot sun for a good seat, to your favorite idol liking all of her fans not just you.\nThe gang is very fun and their high-jinks are wonderful to watch. We also get to watch the members of ChamJam! grow as idols and learn what it takes to be an idol. Dealing with\nfans, understanding your character, the rules you must follow, etc.   Art(7.6): The art is good. There are stylized moments. I can't say much about it. It works for what the series\nneeds.  Sound(8.5): The background songs are good, not annoying. ChamJams! songs are good, not any i've listened to a bunch of times like other shows. It is idol music so those not\na fan of idol already might find the music not intresting.  Characters(10): Oh here it is, the place this anime shines. The characters are the series selling point, Eripyo alone is\nhours of entertainment. Her overreactions over the smallest thing, to her truly dedicating her life to supporting Maina. Her fellow idol fans are also amazing characters. Being the\nstereotype overweight idol otaku, and the skinny in love with an idol (who looks a lot like his sister) character. I am sure you will find them amazing if you give this series a\nfew episodes.  Enjoyment:(10) I only really like reviewing anime/manga when i'm passionate about them. This is one of them. I plan to buy the manga, and hope to get the bluerays\nwhen they come out. I am honestly going to miss watching this series every week. So did I enjoy it? Yes. YES. YES.  Overall:(9) I'm not going to tell you this is the greatest\nanime, because it is very much not. I will not say it is the greatest slice-of-life either. But it is not trying to be. This is simple a series looking at the joys of being a super\nidol fan. A wise anime fan once said that we love to watch characters who are passionate about something, you can feel their passion leak into you. That is the case here. I feel\nEripyo's excitement every time Maina does something cute or ChamJam! advances their idol career. I highly recommend giving this series a chance. Give it 2 or 3 episodes and I hope\nyou will at least enjoy it. The hidden gem of this season.",

         "Heroines Run the Show is an interesting look at idol culture through the lens of the companies responsible for it. Throughout the series, we get to see how the management team\nhandles LIPxLIP while trying to bridge the gap between the boys and their high school peers. The relationship that develops between Hiyori and her charges is mostly wholesome, even\ngoing so far as to subvert expectations a few times, particularly regarding Hiyori's more \"tomboy\" appearance. Aizo and Yujiro start out antagonistic toward her and each other, but\neven they can't remain immune to the power of the enthusiastic protagonist forever. Their dynamic is funto watch, but unfortunately Hiyori's background is the only one that feels\nmost fleshed out. Every other character that gets introduced in the show has their one story to explain their presence or motivation and they're sticking to it, whether they get\ndevelopment or not. That being said, it works for the episodic nature of the anime.  Since this is an idol show, of course there are plenty of fun performances to enjoy. Not only\ndo the episodes have their own sequences within the story, but the show as a whole showcases a handful of different EDs that feature the characters performing. Still, it's the\nstage shows that truly take the cake. The moment the idols take the stage to perform a song, the animation shift becomes just noticeable enough that it's weirdly uncanny. It isn't\nbad in the least, but it doesn't blend so seamlessly into the rest of the animation that it escapes the watchful eye either. It's so fluid that it's either rotoscope (most likely)\nor some very convincing CGI.  Unfortunately, what really leaves the biggest impression is the show's stance on idol culture and the fans who participate in it. It's nothing new for\nmedia about idols to focus on how the idols themselves need to work hard to impress their fans because anything that upsets the fans (and negatively impacts their popularity) is\nsomehow considered to be directly their fault, but this show goes another step further by trying to encourage obsessive behavior via the parasocial relationship these managerial\nteams try so hard to cultivate. Clearly, the stance it has taken on matters such as stalking and fan jealousy is a cop out so as to not upset the status quo. There is a small plea\nin the last episode for fans to think about who they're hurting before they act on their feelings, but it is largely overshadowed by affirmations that idols love and appreciate\ntheir fans and understand that these behaviors are signs that the fans love and support the idols back.  Overall, it's a fun show with entertaining characters and music. Definitely\nworth a watch if the idol genre is your thing.",

         "Zombieland Saga is both a great starting point for anime fans who want to get into idol anime and an anime that effectively reflects and provides commentary on aspects of the idol\nindustry. As a fan of idol anime, I would recommend this show to anyone regardless of how familiar they are with the genre. Now with that out of the way, let's get into the meat.\nOne of the biggest things that stick out about this anime is the premise itself. Compared to other idol anime (such as Love Live!, The Idolm@ster, etc.), the idea of idol zombies\nis just ridiculous enough to drawin fans of many different genres. The plot skirts the line between concrete and ambiguous, which lets the watcher fill in any blanks that may be in\ntheir minds. Turning the main idols into zombies introduces this pseudo-horror-comedy element which works incredibly well to keep watchers interested during each episode. This is\none of the best things I love about this anime: it has plenty of scenes that can keep many different watchers interested and doesn't drive viewers away by being too idol-centric.\nOn the flip side, there are plenty of aspects to Zombieland Saga, which appeals to the idol genre's big fans. Many scenes, plotlines, and character actions can be viewed as\ncritiques of the idol industry. A few involve some spoilers to get too far into it, but I will use the girls' zombification as an example. The zombie idols are a good\nrepresentation of the obscene amount of work that idols have to go through, and Koutarou Tatsumi's attitude towards them reflects how many idols are treated as objects rather than\npeople. I'm definitely not an expert, though, so interpret it however you'd like.   The characters are enjoyable to follow and have plenty of depth. Being from many different eras,\nevery character feels unique (especially the LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE) and brings different experiences and outlooks to the idol group. I won't go too far into it, but none of the\ngirls feel unnecessary or flat, which is very refreshing to see. If you want to know more, you should watch the show and meet them yourself!   I would be remiss if I didn't mention\nthe music. The show immediately defies expectations by including songs that seemingly wouldn't fit in idol anime at all, but Zombieland Saga makes them work to great effect. The\nseiyuu are unbelievably talented. Zombieland Saga's cast is definitely one of my favorites out of all the anime I've watched (the LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE is especially well-voiced).\nI'll also mention the animation during the song sequences, considering that they can be controversial in quality. The show starts with iffy concert animation, but it uses that as a\nmetric to show how much the group improves over the show, which is a clever way to poke some fun at other idol anime and get the viewer excited to see the next concert. Also, the\nOP is really good. It's found a nice place on my main playlist.   I'll round this out by telling you how much I enjoyed it. I had a dumb grin on my face the whole time I was\nwatching Zombieland Saga. I loved the characters and shared their troubles and triumphs throughout the show. The music dug into my ears, and I found myself humming the songs for\nmonths. As a big fan of the horror genre, I also enjoyed the kernels of it in the show. Also, Nikaidou Saki is best girl.   If you haven't watched Zombieland Saga, I highly\nrecommend that you get started on it right away.",

         "If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die That is the English title of the anime. Somehow it sounds like a goal in your life, but certainly a weird one. I am a\nbig idol fan myself, but I would never go that far and say this. There are \"wotas\" (=fans of Japanese idol singers) who would do everything for their favorite idol. They support\nthem with everything they have and this is definitely something that should be respected. It is certainly unusual and hard to understand, especially in western culture.\nNevertheless, it shows how much love the wotas give to theirfavorite idol.  Oshibudo (short form) is about the relationship between the wotas and their favorite idols in everyday\nlife. It gives us a little insight into this unusual and interesting culture.  STORY: The first imporatant thing we learn is that our idol group \"ChamJam\" is a \"chika\n(underground)\" idol group. Such a group is nowhere near as well-known as the \"mainstream\" idol groups like AKB48 (anime: AKB0048) or Momoiro Clover Z (songs in Sailor Moon,\nDragonBall etc). So what does this exactly mean for the daily life of our \"ChamJam\" idols? Without the unconditional support of their fans, \"underground\" idols would have an\nextremely difficult time. Beside performancing, our idols also have to do side jobs because the wages are not enough. The story is focusing on the main characters Eripiyo-san and\nMaina (both are girls). Eripiyo-san is a wota willing to do anything for her favorite idol Maina. She loves Maina more than anything on the world and also shows this noticeably.\nShe supports her in every aspect she can. Since Maina is a shy girl and often doesn't dare to say the right words, it is difficult for her to show Eripiyo-san how much she\nappreciates her support and how much she loves her for doing this. In addition to the relationship between our main characters, we also see other wotas showing their support for\ntheir favorite idol.  CHARACTER: The development of the idols with the support is certainly the most exciting part. All members of \"ChamJam\" have a different personality and not\nthe same amount of fans. But you have to differentiate between quality and quantity here too. A special fan in your heart can change your entire life and this case is certainly\nhere. The respect between the \"ChamJam\" members is there and no one wants to lose considering the ranking etc to the others. Nevertheless, the harmony is not so strong, even if\nthey support each other. There is still a puzzle piece missing to become a great unit.  ART: The art style differs significantly from the other idol animes such as Love Live! or\nZombieland Saga. The girls are shown cute in a different way. Their performances are also beautiful to watch and the animations have a perfect flow.  SOUND: The songs of \"ChamJam\"\nis nice to listen. Although this idol group does not exist in real life with live performances, it is fun to watch the animation and listen to the music. The OP \"Clover Wish\" is\nsung by all seven members and you can feel the happiness in such idol songs. The ED song, on the other hand, is a solo by Eripiyo-san (Ai Fairouz). She is one of the winners of the\ncategory \"Best New Actress\" 2020 and many know her as \"Hibiki\" from \"Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?\" as well. Her voice perfectly fits with the ED song.  ENJOYMENT: As someone who has\nalready watched many idol animes, I had a lot of fun watching Oshibudo. I personally like the idol art style e.g in Love Live! or Re:Stage more, but this variant also has its\ncharm. Learning more about \"chika (underground)\" idols was also very interesting, these things are hardly mentioned otherwise.  For erveryone who wants to discover more about the\nidol culture, I definitely recommend watching this anime. But this anime is also great to watch for people with little idol experience. You can see how much ONE loyal supporter can\nchange everything. With the relationship between the idols and their wotas, this anime has a different focus compared to others. This new aspect gives us a deeper insight into the\nJapanese wota culture.",

Assuming the role of an abrasive manager, Koutarou begins scheduling events; the girls go along with it, eventually deciding to name their idol group Franchouchou. An absurdly comedic take on the idol genre, Zombieland Saga tells the story of Franchouchou's heartwarming struggle to save Saga Prefecture while hiding their zombie identities and rediscovering their past lives."

         "Freshly graduating middle school, energetic 15-year-old Hiyori Suzumi moves from her coastal hometown to Tokyo, pursuing her dream of being a track and field runner. Unfortunately, as soon as her first high school year begins, she faces an imminent problem that ultimately causes her to find a part-time job to cover living costs.\n\nAfter searching through countless prospective workplaces, Hiyori stumbles upon a posting looking for event staff, to which she gets accepted against all odds. It is revealed that she will be working as a manager-in-training for LIPxLIP, a rising male idol group composed of Yuujirou Someya and Aizou Shibasaki—both of whom are coincidentally her classmates. Despite this shocking revelation, Hiyori is resolved to do her best with balancing her studies, her ambition, and most importantly, her role as LIPxLIP's attendant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

         "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a great addition to the Cowboy Bebop series, but no more. It is by no means a sequel, and after watching it, I found that it's best\nwatched in the middle of the series, and not neccesarily at the end. If it's got a specific place or not, that I don't know, but that's not very important at any rate, and if\nyou've watched the entire series, it shouldn't be hard to mentally place it inside the series anyway. This time, a terrorist possesses a weapon capable of killing countless people,\nand there's a bounty of 300 millionwoolongs on him; the largest bounty ever given. Of course, this means that our heroes will chase him. And so starts the process of gathering\ninformation, meeting and getting to know people related to the bounty in some way, and eventually, squaring off against him in a final fight. Oh, and throw in a save-the-world\nthing this time, and there you have the movie. Nothing really new, a formula that's been used several times. There's also details here and there left unexplained, and things  may\njust happen for no reason at the rare occasion. Its 120 minutes might be a little too long to some, but it never came off as boring at any point to me; they certainly did a good\njob of fleshing out those 120 minutes.   Though, that may be credited more to the characters than the plot itself, as the movie threw some really interesting characters at us. The\norignal cast is, well, pretty much the same as they always are, the same characters which you (probably) got to love while watching the original series. As for the movie\ncharacters, we have for example Vincent, the main bad guy. He's quite the interesting fellow, though the more I think about it, the more I can't help but feel that I've experienced\nhis type somewhat before - he's got a mysterious past; a forgotten love included, he's going to kill loads of people for no good reason, and he blathers out sentences about\nreligion and whatnot. Nevertheless, he comes off as an interesting character, mostly because of him being similar to Spike - both in physical prowess and their considering\nthemselves 'dead' men due to past events. Then we have Electra, Vincent's past love once forgotten. She remembers him though, and well, she wants him to remember her as well. We\ncan see where that's heading...  The animation quality is superb; its detail and overall quality is unmistakably a work done by people who knows what they are doing. Be it\nbackgrounds or landscapes, they're all top-notch. Lighting effects are good, and more than I'd exect from something out of 2001, and the overall quality of special effects are\ngreat; much, much better than the original series. The character designs are the same old, with some improvements, and they work very well with this anime and movie. The character\nmotions and their fluidity are great, and the few action scenes in the movie are done so well that I could probably learn some nice figthing moves merely from studying them. The\ncoloring is the only thing that's a bit behind, but considering its age it's not a problem. And moreso, the dulled coloring actually melds perfectly with the style of the movie,\nand helps on the movie's atmosphere.  The soundtrack is what you should expect from the original series; awesome. Yoko Kanno does her work as she did in the series; with an amazing\nsoundtrack that fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie and its individual scenes, and the opening and ending themes are wonderful to listen to. The only downside is that\nthere is a lot of silent scenes, where no background music is present at all.   Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door is a movie that delivers the goods, but stops at that. It's\nnot marvelous, but it's great, and a must-see movie for any Cowboy Bebop fan.",

         "I'm never that comfortable with films of series. Mostly, that's because all too often a film of a series consists of some kind of edited-all-to-hell clip show that tries and\ntotally fails to boil down the story of a long series to a relatively much shorter film. Knockin' on Heaven's Door isn't that, which is very much in its favour. Rather, it's\nbasically like a two-hour &quot;lost episode&quot; that belongs somewhere in the middle of the series - without spoiling anything, by the end of the series, there's characters\nmissing who are still present in this film. Another point in the film's favouris that it's pretty much equally accessible for existing fans and those unfamiliar with the\ncharacters.  While there's plenty of details that might be lost or not fully comprehensible for new viewers, by and large the film stands up well as a stand alone drama,\nintroducing its characters and their situation.  However, this in a way exposes another major weakness of films of series.  Series are, by nature, episodic.  They devote an episode\nto introducing a character or exploring their personalities.  Once this is done, they generally have plot episodes, in which the main thrust of the series is pursued, and then they\nhave one-shot episodes that have our characters in some kind of interesting situation, but which is basically unrelated to the plot - if there is one.  Films, by contrast, do all\nof this at once.  The proceedure is totally different, and a director or scriptwriter used to a series format adapts less well to a film format.   Knockin' on Heaven's Door\nexemplifies this - while the film as it is works, it's more obvious and cumbersome than a film directed by a director used to a feature-length format.  The storyline, also, suffers\nin this way.  It's not that it's a bad story, in fact it might make a great two- or three-part episode, but as a film, the material comes across as stretched, holey and lacking in\nsubstance.  It's also remarkable in that it's not half as quirky or original as Cowboy Bebop's famously eclectic mixtures of ideas: biological terrorism unleashed by a madman with\na mysterious and sinister military past, fascinated by death and bent on destroying the world, with cod philosophical pretentions to fil gaps between action and a garnish of some\nfashionable christian mythology. It's all very generic really, and frankly the only things that make this Cowboy Bebop and not something much more generic are the familiar\ncharacters, who are luckily strong enough to make the thing hang together.  The new characters are not much to speak of, either - Vincent the aforementioned madman, a hacker\naccomplice, a Moroccan information seller and, of course, Electra, a tough, wildcard femme fatale with a mysterious connection to our antagonist.  Electra comes off as the best\nrealised of these, and, perhaps not coincidentally, closest to a series character (though she's a dead ringer for a more mature version of BGC2040's Priss as well).  Vincent seems\nvery like main series antagonist Vicious stripped of his hatred of Spike, which is to say, not that special and a bit rabid and foaming for credibility.  The film drags.  It's just\ntoo long.  What this is primarily due to is unclear; maybe an over-developed story with far too much exposition (every character seems to need every other to explain nanomachines\nto them, it seems.  We, however, do not), or perhaps the increasingly egregious and segmented action scenes (why are there spitfires on Mars?  Who knows, let's cut back to Spike\nbeing pursued by military jets for no apparent reason!), or it could be the ponderous attempts to fashion some sort of existential aspect to the story (&amp;quot;I'm not insane,\nthe rest of the world is.&amp;quot; - oh really?  You don't look thirteen years old, Vincent, but you sound it).  Philosophical-minded action films are not especially uncommon;\ngood and effective ones are extremely rare.  Suffice it to say that I was surprised and rather disappointed when the apparent climax occured and passed with a good half an hour\nleft on the clock.  As I say, the film hangs almost completely on the main characters.  It would have been unthinkable to not bring the original cast in for this gig too (can't\nspeak for the dub cast, don't know), and they all acquit themselves just as well as they do in the series.  Music, too, such a central part of the series, is again provided by Yoko\nKanno and the Seatbelts; while the styles used in and prominence given to the music may not be to everyone's tastes, the versatility and range Kanno's score covers while still\nretaining a high basic quality standard is nothing short of incredible.  Visually, the quality seems to have been kicked up a notch; the animation of the series was never bad, but\nthe film is sumptuous and extremely well detailed.    However, one of my main bones of contention remains.  The art design is realistic, unapologetically multicultural and sort of\ngrimy, very credible in its way, but under even cursory analysis, it's illogical in the extreme.  Why is Mars covered in early twentieth-century New York-style tenement blocks and\nlabyrinthine Moroccan markets?  Has anyone remembered that it has one third of earth's gravity?  Is there, in fact, any reason for this to be set on Mars at all, other than to tie\nin all these diverse elements?  It's sci-fi doing what sci-fi does most often and least well - making half-baked stuff up to accomodate its ideas, with no thought for maintainance\nof disbelief suspension.  I was never as bowled over by Cowboy Bebop as many people seem to have been.  Overall I liked it, certainly, in fact I thought some of it was absolutely\nexcellent, but other parts I thought were pretty terrible, and it was quickly clear that the series was never going to be &amp;quot;a classic&amp;quot; in my eyes the way it is for\nlots of others.  This was primarily because of its disjointedness and apparent lack of story direction, and the same is true of this film.  Now, after watching it, I'm left with\nthe same &amp;quot;...well, so what?&amp;quot; feeling a significant amount of the series gave me, but because of the length and the negative impact it has, I have comparatively\nmore holes to pick at as well.  Perhaps if you're a real fan, this film has more to offer, but overall, for me, while I'd not actually call it bad, this doesn't reach the already\nkind of saggy standard the series set.",

         "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door was released in Japan on September 1st, 2001. Shinichiro Watanabe stayed on as director, and it was produced this time by not only Sunrise,\nbut also Bandai Visual (famous for their work on the .hack series and Dennou Coil), and Bones (famous for their work on Fullmetal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club). It was\nreleased Stateside by Bandai on August 11th, 2002. It's just a few days before Halloween on Ganymede, a major national holiday, and a terrorist has blown up a tanker filled with a\nbiochemical weapon. The government posts a 300 million Wulongbounty for the terrorist, and the Bebop crew just decides to go after it.  But the more they investigate, the deeper\nthe rabbit hole seems to go...  Yes, to answer any questions ahead of time, this is not a sequel; it takes place between episodes twenty-two and twenty-three.  It's not quite what\nI was expecting, admittedly, but it's still a pretty good plot.  It could've been fit in the series as a two or three part episode, and apparently Wantanabe had wanted to\noriginally, but he couldn't have gotten away with it on TV.  The visuals for this are absolutely beautiful; the animation got an update in the three years since the show had aired,\nand things are definitely smoother than they were in the show.  There's an even more unprecedented amount of detail in this, and it's absolutely beautiful.  Yoko Kanno and the\nSeatbelts came back to do work on the music again, and it's just as awesome and catchy as it was in the series.  I found myself humming a few of the songs after it was done.  All\nthe seiyuu and the voice actors were able to return for the movie, which just adds t o the awesomeness of the movie in general.

         "It was a good follow up (in-between, actually) to the series. I suggest that if youre planning to watch Cowboy Bebop – Knockin on Heavens Door, you should watch after you get to\nthe episode when Ed is introduced. You just need to get to know all 4 major characters to understand the movie. I didnt like it as much as the series, mostly because the series\nkept me interested by introducing new plot lines in each episode. Having to focus on one specific plot for 120 minutes was a bit exhausting. It has a nice plot – throughout the\nmovie youll get why Knockin onHeavens Door is part of the title. I also found the plot to be timely. Terrorism is a problem thats been widespread throughout the world for years,\nand its interesting to see a group of bounty hunters trying to do something good for mankind.  The characters are back, of course. Theyre still the same as they were in the series.\n2 more major characters are introduced throughout the movie. The villain is Vincent Volaju, a mysterious terrorist with a forgotten past. He is definitely convincing as a villain,\nat least I think so. Electra is also a character added to the mix. I didnt really like her, mostly because she looks like a guy, but her presence is important to the story. The\noriginal voice actors are also back to reprise their respective roles. I would have been mad if they changed the voice actors.  I think one of the major innovations in the movie is\nthe visuals. The visuals are 10 times more stunning than in the series, all thanks to the collaboration with BONES studio. I guess it may have something to do with the fact that it\nwas produced in 2001, and 2001 animation definitely improved since 1998. The screenplay was also as great as before.  Yoko Kanno came back to do the music again, but I have to say\nIm a bit disappointed. There were less tracks than there were in the series, and there were a lot of scenes where there was no background music at all. That was a rare occurrence\nin the series. The opening theme, \"Ask DNA\" by The Seatbelts featuring Raju Ramayya and the ending theme \"Gotta Knock a Little Harder\" by The Seatbelts featuring Mai Yamane, were\nreally nicely done though.  Obviously, I liked the series better, but that may have something to do with the fact that I finished the series first before watching the movie. Its\nkind of hard to top the ending of the series, so its best if you watch the movie in between the series.",

         "Warning : minor spoilers ahead It was a month ago when I finished cowboy bebop series, and i would say that i was a little bit disappointed. Why would I be disappointed? Well,\nmostly because many episodes almost feel like fillers, they don't support character development and some enemies just minor criminals/bounties and those villains rarely have\ninteresting characters. After sometime, I decided to watch the CB movie. And I would say the movie was very good. This movie has the elements that some cowboy bebop episodes lack.\nMostly the well developed story and characters(villains). Story (8/10) \"Which one is dream? Which one is reality? A 'deadman', searchingfor that answer, tries to endanger the\nsociety. It is up to Spike and the gang to stop him\". Yup, that was pretty much the synopsis of the movie. Like the series, the story presents a sci-fi modern era where humans has\nlived in other planets. Our MCs (Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed), are bounty hunters. This time, they are trying to catch an unknown terrorist. Unlike the series, which lack episodic story\ndevelopment because they have only 20 minutes duration for one story, the movie has almost 2 hours duration. It really has a great difference to tell a story. The story plot is\nvery well chronologically executed, and not rushed. We got to see a complex investigation, gaining information, interesting background story and past of the main villain, good\naction scenes, and a nice final conclusion of all of them. The big differences i felt most with the series are this movie presents us a nice built villains, well developed plot,\nbigger case and conflicts that put our MCs in critical situation, which rarely seen in the series.  Art (9/10) Considering the time it was aired, I would say the animations are\ngreat. The backgrounds are nice and the movements were fluid. But what I like most is the character design. It was unique in my opinion, no moe, and it gives me more mature\natmosphere from it.  Sound (8/10) The sountrack is like the original series, the classic ones. Nice OP and ED. Soundtracks also fit well with the atmosphere of the scenes. Though a\nfew scenes were quiet and don't have BGM in it. Voice acting is also good.  Character (8/10) We got our MCs back, Spike and the gang, whose characters are the same with the series.\nSpike being a cool badass, Faye being selfish and ignorant, Jet who is sometimes being the most sane one, and Ed is.. crazy..  What really caught my attentions was the main\nvillain's character, Vincent. A man with an interesting past that leads to his interesting philosophy (which one is dream, which one is reality). To seek his answes he will do\nanything. Interesting terrorism, which he also left mystery to be solved. Above all that, he also really got some skills to overpower the main protagonist.   Enjoyment (8/10) Yeah,\nlet's make this one short. From the scores above I'd say I really enjoy this movie. It was a nice watch and it has cured my disappointment of CB franchise.  Overall (8/10) Cause\nthe majority of above scores  i gave were 8s, then my overall score would be 8, which means really good.",

In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs. With his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash's agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point."

         "If you're looking for a documentary to sate your curiosity about the obscure phenomenon of rumbling schools, look elsewhere. Unfortunately, School Rumble is NOT a show about a\nschool that rumbles. Thankfully, it's a damn good romantic comedy that's actually funny! Don't let the word \"romantic\" fool you into thinking that it'll be anything like Clannad or\nChu2 either. There's no annoying melodrama to be found anywhere, no teenage angst to put a damper on your good mood, or any of that bullshit. There's also no overarching story that\nforces you to sit through every episode either. This is the kind of show that youcan sit down and enjoy with your friends whilst laughing your asses off and eating some pizza (even\nif they're not into anime), and that's the kind of show I just love to watch!  In terms of story, School Rumble is the anime equivalent of a late-90s Cartoon Network show like\nDexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Ed, Edd n Eddy, or The Powerpuff Girls: there's no overarching plot, it's mostly episodic, and nothing of significance happens by the time the\nseason's over. Whereas most romantic comedies to come out in recent years focus more on the romance, School Rumble just tries to make you laugh and if my results are anything to go\nby, I'm sure you'll get more than just a quiet chuckle every now and then. Then again, comedy is purely subjective and I know damn well there some popular comedies that failed to\nmake me laugh even once (cough cough The Big Bang Theory cough cough) but let's not open up that can of worms right now.  Keeping in line with that late-90s Cartoon Network comedy\nfeel, every episode of School Rumble is told in three 7-minute long segments that have next-to-nothing to do with each other. Each segment tackles a simple dilemma that one (or\nboth) of our airheads in love will have to put up with like Harima trying to sit next to Tenma during the school field trip or Tenma trying to sketch Kurasama during art class. I\ncan safely say that this approach worked incredibly well to School Rumble's favour. The concept of each segment is incredibly simple, which makes room for a lot of jokes to be told\nand the segment's just short enough to prevent that concept from getting stale and repetitive. Another upside to this is the fact that you don't have to sit through the entire\nepisode either. I mean, I like to watch segments from episodes of School Rumble on my phone when I'm on the bus to class and by the time the segment's over, the bus is already at\nthe college.  Really, the only complaint I have with the show is that I can't really sit down and watch more than 1-2 whole episodes at a time but that's basically the way I am\nwith comedy shows in general. Whilst I have no problem with comedy, I enjoy shows that have much more to offer than the comedy alone. If I was given the choice to watch an episode\nof GTO or an episode of School Rumble, I'd probably go with the former since GTO has a lot more to it than just the comedy. But then again, everyone's different so maybe you might\nbe the kind of person who can just sit down and marathon 12 episodes in one sitting.  If you're expecting multi-faceted individuals that parallel the kind of questionable morality\nthat real humans tend to have, look elsewhere. School Rumble's characters aren't compelling individuals in the slightest, nor do they undergo any significant change throughout the\ncourse of the series. You know what? That's okay! I mean, Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, and The Powerpuff Girls had static characters and yet people love the everliving Christ\nout of those shows. This doesn't mean that the characters in School Rumble are terrible. In fact, they're far from it. Tenma and Harima are quite possibly some of the most\nendearing and hilarious airheads in all of comedy anime. If School Rumble ever took itself a little more seriously, you'd bet your sweet ass I'd be shipping the hell out of those\ntwo (oh fuck it, I still do!). All of the supporting characters play off of Tenma and Harima exceptionally well too. I never get tired of Tenma's friends and their reactions to her\nlatest scheme to end up with Kurasama. Speaking of Kurasama... there isn't much I really can say about him except he reminds me of Octavius Rex from that episode of Spongebob where\nSpongebob takes Pearl to prom.  There isn't a lot I can really say about School Rumble beyond the fact that it's funny. I mean, the jokes are well-timed and they actually work, the\nEnglish dub is some of Funimation's best work to date (especially given that we have amazing voice actors like Her Highness Lucy Christian as Tenma and Brandon Potter as Harima),\nbut that's basically it. Sure, I can go on and talk about the artwork, the animation, and the soundtrack but I'm pretty sure most people don't go into a comedy show for the\npinnacle of audio-visual quality.   Overall, I give School Rumble an 8/10. It's not the epitome of comedy gold like Gintama apparently is, but it's still pretty damn funny! If\nyou're in the mood for a comedy show that you can watch with your friends and have a damn good time watching it, this show fits the bill and then some. I mean, you don't even need\nto know anything about Japanese culture to even understand the jokes in the first place and there isn't much in the way of fan service or juvenile humour at that. This is something\nyou can actually watch with your family provided that they're willing to give it a shot. Unless you have some sort of long-standing visceral hatred of romantic comedies (or\ncomedies in general), there's no reason why you shouldn't give this show a chance. Anyway, that's it for this review. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n***  Since I haven't done any alternate recommendations in a while, here are a few shows you should check out if you're in the mood for something like School Rumble: - Ouran HSHC\n(the English dub is some really hilarious stuff) - Azumanga Daioh (the quintessential slice-of-life comedy) - Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu (another hilarious slice-of-life comedy with\nLuci Christian as the leading lady) - Great Teacher Onizuka (much more crass and vulgar than School Rumble, but every bit as hilarious. Plenty of sweet and heartwarming moments to\ngo around and hey, it actually has character development! Steve Blum was even cast as Onizuka, what's not to like?!)",

         "A prison gay review of Prison School Prison School is a comedy about a group of 5 boys who attempt to peek on the girl's changing rooms in their school, but after being caught by\nthe Gestapo-esque Underground Student Council, are subjected to imprisonment inside of the school's grounds. Herein, the main characters attempt to survive the brutality of the\nUSC, as they conspire against the boys, trying to expel them. Prison School is an extremely ecchi anime, on par with actual hentai, and it is completely unapologetic on this front.\nNot only is the fanservice omnipresent (with the USC's vice president more or less servingentirely this role, whose breast size probably set a world record), but, the characters\nroutinely experience severe punishment for their misdeeds, which is a great pleasure for someone with a reverse ryona fetish, such as myself.  As a comedy, Prison School's main\nentertainment value lies in its ability to be comedic. The writing is well-done, but where Prison School really shines is with its characters. While the main character, Kiyoshi is\nrelatively 'normal', others, such as the masochistic Andre, Joe, who has a loving for ants, and Gakuto, my personal favourite of the series, an otaku with a strong interest in the\nThree Kingdoms (a historical period when China was separated into three kingdoms, as the name implies) with very strong leadership abilities, strategies, and an overall strong\ncharacter, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. Additionally, his voice actor did an excellent job, and captured his character greatly.  The storyline of Prison School can\nbe summarised in a few sentences, as I did earlier in this review, even, but the episode by episode happenings are far from predictable. Each episode is varied and the exploits of\nthe pentagonists are all a pleasure to view. This writing is particularly good for a comedy anime.  Overall, Prison School is a well-made anime. It's not one of the greatest\ncomedies ever written, and some may find it hard to look past the raunchy nature of it, but if you can, you're in for one of the best balances of story, comedy and characters I've\nseen in an anime of this genre for quite some time.",

With the only other club member being the beautiful ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita, Hachiman finds himself on the front line of other people's problems—a place he never dreamed he would be.

However, this is all about to change due to the revision of the school's most iconic policy, as boys are now able to enroll as well. At the start of the first semester under this new decree, a mere five boys have been accepted, effectively splitting the student body into a ratio of two hundred girls to one boy. Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Andre, and Jo are quickly cast away without having a chance to make any kind of a first impression. Unable to communicate with their fellow female students, the eager boys set their sights on a far more dangerous task: peeping into the girls' bath! It's only after their plan is thoroughly decimated by the infamous Underground Student Council that the motley crew find their freedom abruptly taken from them, as they are thrown into the school's prison with the sentence of an entire month as punishment. Thus begins the tale of the boys' harsh lives in Prison School, a righteous struggle that will ultimately test the bonds of friendship and perverted brotherhood."

         "Kabaddi is a contact team sport which involves no material equipment but the human body to play. It is the national sport of Bangladesh, the country where I'm from and has\nhistorical origins in Ancient India, particularly in Tamil Nadu around 4000 years ago. Legend says that even Gautam Buddha enjoyed playing this game. Of all sports known globally,\nKabaddi was a sport I never imagined to get an anime adaption, so kudos to the mangaka, Hajime Musashino, for introducing this rather unknown sport to Otakus and making it look\ncool. All the characters were enjoyable to watch, even the opponent and side characters. The animation was prettygood. It was not impressive to some others but I will let it pass.\nMaybe I am biased, but I played it as a kid and felt a rather historical-cultural connection about an anime that talked about a unpopular sport that is still simple and accessible;\nso I didn't mind the intricacies much. Rather I was more surprised that it even tried to feed a good plot, a good story with emotional value with the usual tropes you see in other\nsports anime.  This anime sadly flew under the radar because everyone else has preferences of trashy tropes and not try something out of the unknown; I mean, the anime did a good\njob in introducing the sport to its viewers for the first few episodes who may be unfamiliar with it.  This is the type of anime you would wish had more than 12 episodes. In\nBangladesh, we call it 'Ha-du-du'. Kabaddi also has a World Cup for both men's and women's teams organized by the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). Look it up.",

         "I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting\nso much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free). I was really\nshocked to see a anime about running that does not show any character running until ep 5 or 6, I mean how sports anime do that these days. Rather then making us show the characters\nrunning from the start it takesthat time to develop the characters itself, because what good a shallow character is to the show. And mind you this anime has a lot of characters\nthat need ample to develop and shine in limited amount of time, but damn not a single minute of any ep is wasted and its pure story-telling and good characters dynamics.  I wish I\nhad anything to complain about this anime but this anime does not let me do that because its that good, I really like how Haiji interacts with with other characters and how genuine\nhe is. Also how kakeru goes from being a antisocial to just being friendly with everyone, its just  heartwarming. And akane is my soul animal, really he is so relatable and puts so\nmuch effort to come out of his comfort zone for something that only benefits other the most.  This is how a sports anime should be done and every other sports anime should take\nnotes from this. If you want to know what a really good sports anime looks like then you need to watch anime.",

Obviously, the show is not targeted toward\nthe hockey community and more towards introducing Japan to a sport that is not too big. Still, the show is a very unrealistic portrayal of the sport and doesn't represent the sport\nat all. I can keep spewing but mostly to sum it up you have a team of beginner players with their own rink, personal pro shop, and facilities with only a roster of 5 skaters and a\ngoalie, theteam is named Dream Monkeys, and their main selling point to performing victory dances every time they win.  Other than their portrayal of the basis and rules of the\ngame this anime fails to show what the sport is truly like and if the intent is to push popularity toward the sport many people are gonna be disappointed if they think this show\nrepresents the true sport.  TLDR: JAPAN BEATS TEAM CANADA WTF If you think this is a actual hockey anime don't waste your time",

         "I think there's a lot of merit to judging an anime not on what it tells you, but what it shows you. Days, an anime about football, or American Soccer as it's called in the rust\nbelt, wants to tell me that football is an exciting daring sport where any boy, beefy or lanky, can play his heart out. However, the message it shows is that football is a boring\nsport only Europeans could love. What's far, far more important is boys' love. Look, there's only two reasons why anyone watches sports anime: to watch hot muscle boys fight each\nother, and to watch hotboys almost kiss each other. This anime flat out fails at the first and somewhat performs on the second. If there's a second season, we need more boys\nfalling awkwardly on top of each other and looking into each others eyes. It's a football game, it should be happening like every other minute already.  You'll be too busy keeping\na tally of the times the main characters almost kiss to notice anything about the sound design or the artistic direction. I can't even remember very much about the actual sports\nmatches, and sometimes you'll see a football in the screen and think \"Why is this in my Boys' Love anime? Is it supposed to symbolize something?\" and then remember that this is\nsupposed to be a sports anime.  This succeeds at being an anime. I can honestly praise it enough for that, and I probably have already praised it too much. I'd suggest watching\nthis anime if you want to lose interest in football forever and make a transition to a sport less humiliating like lacrosse. I'd also suggest watching this if you're into boys'\nlove because, boy oh boy, there's a lot of boy action in this anime.  Do you remember that family guy joke, where the truck with chocolate crashes into the truck with peanut\nbutter, and makes reeses peanut butter cups? Stop watching family guy, throw out your football, pick up a lacrosse butterfly net and watch this anime.",

         "Arknights : Prelude to dawn is an anime adaptation of a game with the same name. 1- The story of Arknights takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a disease has infected some\npeople causing them to slowly die and infect others after death. The infected people are discriminated against by the non-infected governments which causes a group of infected\ncalled reunion to become terrorists. The main characters are a group called rhodes island which are made up of infected people working for a world in which the infected and non-\ninfected can coexist in peace. If we ignore the game and look at the anime asa separate project, the story is well written and developed. The world and characters were introduced\nproperly and in overall the anime was interesting and amusing.   2- The animation style was (for me) interesting. The background was well drawn and the characters were ell\ndesigned, however the anime was lacking in fight scenes (probably due to limited budget). My score for animation will be 7/10.  3- Although i haven't been playing the game for a\nlong time,I found that the anime has captured the feelings of the game creators. The characters were well developed and the world was built based on in-game designs. Many people\nhave found that the anime was rushed and didn't give the characters the time and attention they needed that was probably due to the game length (8 episodes which took me a day to\nfinish equals to 3 chapters in-game which took a month to finish). As a new player i cannot give a professional opinion however in my experience watching anime Arknights : Prelude\nto dawn was not rushed.  4- I haven't watched many anime game adaptations however Arknights anime was made to be enjoyed by game and non-game players alike. Creating an anime based\non a game is harder than based on a manga however Arknights captured the game story and game play in a way that many other manga adaptations weren't able to. A non game player can\nwatch the anime and understand the game and love the characters without playing the game.  My overall Rating for Arknights is 8/10. This is because the people who made this anime\nmade it for all people not only the ones who played the game. It was made with love and dedication for the game world and characters.",

Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed \"Kirito,\" is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game. In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players.

To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life.

Large veins of Originium can naturally be found at the sites of Catastrophes, various forms of natural disasters caused by the mineral itself.\n\nHowever, the usage of Originium comes at a price, as there is a high risk of getting infected with Oripathy—an incurable and highly contagious disease. Because nations subject the infected to harsh discrimination, the oppressed begin a dissident movement. Calling themselves Reunion, the rebel faction mercilessly destroys cities, further contributing to the already calamitous nature of Catastrophes.\n\nRhodes Island, committed to treating the infected and uninfected as equals, is a paramilitary pharmaceutical organization believed to be the most advanced in its research for the Oripathy cure. Unfortunately, the person spearheading the project—an enigmatic figure known only as the Doctor—suffers from amnesia, effectively impeding what might be the only hope for the infected to break free from their chains of despair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Coming off the hype from Dr. Stone this second season is just more of the same fun\nfound in the first one. The stakes feel higher this season and it really does a good job showcasing the characters preparing for war, and even then, it manages this to look super\nfun. Even with such a serious plot this time around the anime still manages to keep the fun parts and it knows when to not take itself to seriously. This season, just like the\nfirst one, makes youfeel really accomplished as the plot advances. As Senkuu advances the Kingdom of Science's technology you feel like you're there with them in the excitement,\nit's a really exciting and exhilarating experience.

There is not much to explain here because everything is pretty straightforward, there is\nnot many surprises and in writing terms is as simple as it can be but it works pretty well even with that. The commedy is effective, the characters are charismatic, the chemistry\nbetween them is hilarious, is perfect to have a good time. Besides, is from Trigger so the animation has a special expresivity that mesh perfectly with the fun and light tone of\nthe series. There are people who say that the secondhalf is not as fun as the first as is plot centered but is not really a big difference. The plot never is the focus until the\nend and even then most of the elements are pretty predictable so not centering around the weakest element of the series is almost a plus.  The soundtrack is okay, the animation is\nexpressive, fluid and adorable, the characters are really funny and the story is just there. I don't have much to criticize because it suceeds in what it tries but is not something\noverwhelmingly good. Just an amene show to enjoy yourself.

The story is\na simple day in the life of _____ sort of show. It is a fun time too. The art is good and basic for the sort of show it is. If it was too crazy in detail it wouldn't suit this sort\nof show. Whilst the sound lacks oomph it is fine but then also lacking. The sounds generally are pretty fun. The characters are just wild and unexpected which makes fora great\ntime.   Honestly, the show is good nothing more. It feels like if it was in the 1990s/2000s it would be a serious show but here in 2022 it is not and that makes it so much better.\n7/10.",

Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime. They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way."

         "Fumizuki Academy isn't a typical Japanese high school. This unique institution has implemented a new and innovative system to sort its students. At the end of their freshman year, students take a test that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed into A class, all the way down until F class, for the lowest of the low. Unfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii, his supposedly \"great\" intellect wasn't quite enough for such a test, and he's now stuck at the bottom of F class. Naturally, F class has the worst facilities: not only rotten tatami mats and broken tables, but also outdated equipment and worn out furniture. On the bright side, his friend Yuuji Sakamoto is in the same class, and to everyone's surprise, the genius girl Mizuki Himeji has also ended up in the same class due to an unforeseen fever on the day of the test. Unsatisfied with their perquisites, F class rallies behind Yuuji, determined to take on the higher-tiered classes in order to seize their perks by using the school's Examinations Summon Battle system. The participants can summon fantasy characters—whose power levels are equal to their student's test scores—in an all-out battle. Will F class be able to rise to the top, or will they live up to everyone's expectations and fail?"

Much to his chagrin, not only is the location a run-down facility, the supposed date is merely a recruitment tour where Sento and Princess Latifa Fleuranza, the owner of the theme park, ask him to become the park's new manager. Their cause for desperation? As stipulated in a land-use contract, Amagi has less than three months to meet a quota of 500,000 guests, or the park will be closed for good and the land redeveloped by a greedy real-estate company. Seiya is won over by the revelation that Amagi is no ordinary amusement park; many of its employees are Maple Landers—mysterious magical beings who live in the human world and are nourished by the energy created by people having fun. Entrusted with the hopes and dreams of this far-off enchanted land, Seiya must now use his many skills to bring Amagi back on its feet, or watch it crumble before his eyes."

After a chance encounter with the lonely goddess, Hestia, his dreams become a little closer to reality. With her support, Bell embarks on a fantastic quest as he ventures deep within the city's monster-filled catacombs, known only as the \"Dungeon.\" Death lurks around every corner in the cavernous depths of this terrifying labyrinth, and a mysterious power moves amidst the shadows.

Since then, Akko has lived by these words and aspired to be a witch just like Shiny Chariot, one that can make people smile. Hence, even her non-magical background does not stop her from enrolling in Luna Nova Magical Academy. However, when an excited Akko finally sets off to her new school, the trip there is anything but smooth.

Unfortunately, her time at Luna Nova will prove to more challenging than Akko could ever believe. She absolutely refuses to stay inferior to the rest of her peers, especially to her self-proclaimed rival, the beautiful and gifted Diana Cavendish, so she relies on her determination to compensate for her reckless behavior and ineptitude in magic.

If you're looking for a mindblowing plot or well-developed\ncharacters or profound themes, K-On! is not for you. It's just about cute girls doing cute girl things.

Similar to Hanasaku Iroha, but more cute, moe girls that'll make you\nwant to protect them at all cost. There are also some traces of Shoujo Ai, but not to the point where a borderline scale is needed. This anime is just relaxing and fun to watch,\nthere's not too much pressure. And in every episode, you get this \"comfortable\" feeling of pretty much cute, fox girls working. Absolutely fantastic. Story : 10/10 The story is\npretty much cute fox girls doing cute things.. That's about it. Art :10/10   At first before I watched this anime, I thought the art would me mediocre. But after watching the first\nepisode.  I think I'm blind now.   Sound : 10/10   Oh my lord. The sound of the fox girls ( especially Yuzu ) is too fucking kawaii. It's cruel.. The OP also gives you a relaxing\nsensation which is great.   Character : 9.9/10  What made the anime even greater than cute fox girls doing cute things is there's actually character developments. And really good\nones. Some even left me in tears of happiness ( 0 depression )   Though, I find Ren and Natsume a waste of time and feel like they've gotten too much screen-time. ( no offense )\nEnjoyment : 10/10  I really enjoyed this anime. It's peaceful, It's relaxing, It's joyous. Pretty much what I wanted after watching the most cancerous anime I've ever seen in my\nentire life \"Diabolik Lovers\".   Overall : 10/10   This show literally cleaned the cancer I got from Diabolik Lovers. I even cried slightly after the anime ended not because it's\ndepressing. But the experience I had with it was beautiful. Studio Lerche, thank you very much for producing a masterpiece. I have loved your shows ever since Assassination\nClassroom. Keep up the good work!

Unable to play an instrument, she decides to visit to apologize and quit. Meanwhile, the Light Music Club faces disbandment due to a lack of members. This causes the club members to offer anything, from food to slacking off during club time, in order to convince Yui to join. Despite their efforts, Yui insists on leaving due to her lack of musical experience. As a last resort, they play a piece for Yui, which sparks her fiery passion and finally convinces her to join the club.

The youngest student is first grader Renge Miyauchi, who brings an unadulterated wit, curiosity, and her characteristic catchphrase, \"Nyanpasu!\" Then there are the Koshigaya siblings consisting of the quiet ninth grader and elder brother Suguru, diminutive eighth grader Komari, and the mischievous seventh grader Natsumi. The recent arrival of Tokyo-raised fifth grader Hotaru Ichijou, who appears overdeveloped for her age and thus naturally holds an air of maturity, rounds out this lively and vibrant group of five classmates. Based on the manga penned and illustrated by Atto, Non Non Biyori chronicles the not-so-normal daily lives of this group of friends as they engage in their own brand of fun and frolic, and playfully struggle with the realities of living in a rural area."

Set in the future where there are dozens of different planets all over the\nsolar system there is still one past time all species can relate too. Racing. With the new advancement of hover cars, vehicles that can float above the ground, there is one man\nname JP Smooth who still races in his ancient, but highly upgraded Trans Am. With a kicks ass opening that sets the mood for everything to come, JP is injured in the Yellow Line,\nthe qualifying race that gets you a spot in the covenant Redline race. But aftertwo races duck out, he is given a spot. The race, which takes place every five years and is\nextremely illegal, is being held on the planet, Roboworld. Despite everyone's excitement, Robobworld's high conceal doesn't want the race to happen on their world in fear that\ntheir top secret weapons will be reveled, leaving them defenseless.  It's actually a good reason and you kind of understand why this world that has done nothing really wrong\nwouldn't want their secrets revealed on live television. But it doesn't matter, the eight racers are picked and the race is happening right smack dab in the middle of the planets\nmain city. What ensues next, is high octane action that blurs the screen with its fast action and wacky, wild animation. I really did love the way REDLINE looked, it was a balance\nbetween old school looking anime, but felt completely new to the medium. The characters don't have a whole lot to say, probably because there are too many of them and the film only\nruns at a quick hour and forty-two minutes. But with its lack of main character development for the two leads, it makes up for giving us a fair does of all of its characters. JP\nSmooth gets as much background as everyone else, because just like him, everyone else is fighting for one goal, to win Redline.  Everyone from the sexy female driver, Sonoshee\nMcLaren to the vicious, multi time winner Machinehead. To the wacky Boiboi and Bosbos of the grassland planet. Each character is cool in their own way and you can have fun picking\na favorite. I dug REDLINE it was cool, smooth, fun, action packed, silly and just plain awesome. Oh yeah, and the cars could go really fast.",

         "Dead Leaves....... How can I even describe this anime? It's animated by Production I.G., it's directed by the same guy who directed Gurren Lagann and FLCL, and it's is the weirdest\nfucking thing I have ever seen in my life. This is an anime that goes for all style, no substance but it amps it up with so much stuff thrown at you that it is impossible to call\nit that. The easiest way to describe Dead Leaves is this: IT\"S ANIME ON CRACK. The plot of Dead Leaves goes like this: Two people wake up naked on Earth with no recollection of\ntheir memories. Oneis named Retro, the one with the TV screen as a head, and the other is named Pandy because she has a eye that makes her look like a panda. After they wake up,\nthey decide to go steal some clothes, rob food, clothes and weapons, have an orgasmic epic action chase scene with the ENTIRE police force and later on, they get captured and\nsentenced to die on a prison that takes place on the moon, which looks like it's been eating in half. Together with a bunch of other prisoners, they team up to escape from this\nprison by blowing shit-up with style and kicking ass. This is the best way I could describe the plot for Dead Leaves because honestly, there isn't one.  Dead Leaves is all about\nover the top action with a lot of exploding colorful visuals. Seriously, If you're gonna watch Dead Leaves, then don't expect a plot or any kind of character development cause Dead\nLeaves has none of that and when it does, it falls flat on it's face. But even if it doesn't have any story or character development, Dead Leaves just kicks ass and better than\nother overrated popular action anime like High School Of The Dead, which I found that anime to be incredibly shitty. The action in Dead Leaves is an exploding, ultra-violent thrill\nride that never stops and it is crazy. We're talking about a woman and a guy with a TV set as a head unleashing chaos everywhere, a guy with a drill as his penis who uses it as a\nweapon (don't ask), mechas popping out of nowhere and start shooting at everyone, a baby that is a God and a giant caterpillar that starts destroying the moon base Godzilla style.\nThat's how cool and awesome the action in Dead Leaves is and once you're into the action of this anime, you are gonna be re-watching those scenes for eternity. How about the\ncharacters? Honestly, they are likable. While they don't have a lot of development, they are just cool and each have their own strange but unique charm that's it's impossible to\nhate the characters. They're just damn fun.  The animation by Production I.G. is incredibly good-looking, making GITS look like his bitch in comparison. The style is incredibly\nwith so much over the top creativity in it's visuals and colors alone that it holds very well. The character designs are excellent that range from weird to cool to just downright\ninsanely creepy. I just love Retro's design with the TV screen as a head, which is kinda messed-up but at the same time, it is really creative and the rest of the characters look\ngreat. The music consists of heavy techno but it fits and the soundtrack is fun to listen, as well as the dub by Manga Entertainment. Jaxon Lee and Amanda Winn-Lee were perfect for\nthe roles of Retro and Pandy as their delivery was just perfect and the dialogue is pretty vulgar but somehow come off as hilarious. Simply put, you have to see this with the dub\non.  If you're looking for an anime with some story or development, then Dead Leaves is not for you. However, If you're the kind of anime fan that likes crazy action with crazy\ncharacters on a crazy world, then Dead Leaves is your ticket to Paradise. It is good looking, it is action-packed with explosions and action, and overall, just one hell of a fun\nmovie. You have to see Dead Leaves to believe.",

         "I usually never write reviews, but this anime did so many things right that I feel I kind of have to. You just have to get past the sometimes wacky and cartoonish animation style\nand the infinite amount of fanservice and eventually see that the series is so much more than that. After seeing the first couple of episodes I was kind of unsure still and didn't\nquite know what was going on. I was trying to decide whether I like it or not, but from ep 11 onwards I knew I was hooked and from ep 18 till the end it was one crazy,action-packed\ntrip that I wished to never end.   KlK takes its laughable plot, crazy characters, infinite boobs and butts and kick-ass action and rolls it all into a solid, fun and enjoyable\nwatching experience. The story sounds just ridiculous if you try to explain it to someone else, and the battle outfits probably make one roll their eyes, but you have to get sucked\ninto the whole thing and you'll find that in the end you don't even pay attention to it anymore but just want to see how it'll all end. Now, this is something that KlK did just\nright: it took all the cliches and all the fanservice and managed to make it work without boring the viewer and without being too ridiculous. Or should I say, it's all just so over\nthe top and crazy that it actually works.  Most of the characters are likable. (Yes, I'm one of the Mako fans, although I usually hate that type.) The villains are awesome &amp;\nnasty. The music is absolutely fitting for each scene and makes your adrenaline flow. The humor is crazy, as well as the action. Everything works. I have to admit the show starts\noff a little slow but dear god, don't drop this because of that. I think this series deserves a solid 9.",

         "I'm only at episode 5 and I'm frustrated. I loved Vinland Saga season 1. You've probably seen this being said about season 2, but it's too slow. Now I see other people saying how\nit's slow but they mean other things, so I feel like I should explain what I mean when I say that it's slow. I do not need drama and I do not need the show to be action-packed like\nS1 was. The lack of major events and action is not what makes the show \"slow\". It's slow because, there's too much screentime given to useless actions, I'm talking about the\nwalking, thestaring, the pausing. It may seem like I'm nitpicking when I complain that they show them walking up to someone (not a suspenseful moment, it's just a normal encounter\nbetween characters) over 5 seconds instead of 2, but when all that adds up, it gets really boring.   What made me really groan in frustration while watching episode 5 was Canute\nnegotiating with Mercia's lord. So much pausing between sentences would be reasonable if it was to build suspense, but it was not. Even Canute walking out of the house to show the\nlord the burning beacon was excruciatingly slow. Again, it would make sense if it was to create suspense and drama, but let me remind you that there was nothing dramatic happening.\nYes it's scary to imagine Mercia being reduced to ashes, but they were fighting a war anyway, where many were going to die. Yeah, so what's the unexpected twist? There's none?\nThat's fine! But why make it so slow as if it was building up to something dramatic? That's what frustrated me.  Now, the show is still above average to me. The episode where\nThorfin said thank you and sorry to Einar? Made me sniffle. It was so good..! So really, the core of the show is still excellent, it's only the slow walking and frequent pauses in\nconversation.",

Although I've never played the game this anime is based on, at least as of\ntyping this, I was able to follow along with the story, which while simple is effective. The only disappointing aspect of this anime, is the animation. Compared to SAO, a lot of\ntimes, the characters are just standing still shooting at their enemies. Rarely do they run and gun to make the action more engaging. But otherwise, if you want a military-themed\nanime or wanted a Call of Duty anime, this'll do just fine.",

         "Quentin Tarantino is one strange guy. His cult films are homages to the genre portrayed. Reservoir Dogs was an homage to such mob movies as The Godfather and Scarface. Kill Bill\nwas and homage to the western genre of well... westerns as well as the Eastern Kung-Fu or samurai genre. I bring this up because Gun X Sword is a real cult anime that pays homage\nto it's genre. Gun X Sword is a mecha anime revolving around Van and Wendy. Van must find \"The Claw\" whom killed his wife and Wendy must find her brother. This premise, you would\nthink, is very simple andyou know what, you would be right. Much like Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" a good old classic revenge story is what this show is. This is a very strait forward\nshow but that is the charm of the show. It's simplicity is very refreshing. There are no long-winded narrations about the mechs or the weapons used in the show and the story itself\nis cliche but what will keep you coming back to the show is it's over the top style and nature. This show is basically \"Kill Bill\" with giant robots. The action scenes are very\nover the top and fun to watch, making the main character (Van) look totally badass. Action is the main focus in this show and there is one new encounter every episode (exept for\nmaybe 1 or 2). They get progressively better and better until the final action scene which is just absolutely awesome.  The over the top nature that I mentioned earlier is always\npresent in Gun X Sword. How over the top you ask? Well you see, Van wears a tuxedo, all the time, with this large brimmed cowboy hat with a ring on one end. He has a blade that,\nwhen inactive, he wears as a belt with a hilt on his waist for the handle. When he draws his sword, it hardens and turns into an actual blade. He then slashes at the air to make a\nblue \"V\" shape. His mech is then launched down from a satellite shaped like a cross, in the form of a sword. It then transforms into a human-looking robot and Van gets in. To\nactivate it he call it by its name, Dann. The robot that shot down from the havens is named Dann. It is exactly this unexpected nature that keeps you coming back to the show.",

         "This is a show about swords, the title even roughly translates to \"Sword Story\". And what is a sword? well, a sword is an edge with a handle, and if a sword is an edge and this\nshow is about swords (12 of them in fact), thus we can determine that this show must be reasonably edgy. And it does not dissapoint, this series will have you on the edge of your\nseat all 12 episodes through, which should I mention, are 50 minutes long instead of the standard 25 minutes, making this show even more unorthodox and edgy.

         "Welcome back Studio Madhouse. The person chosen for the director role was Sunao Katabuchi whom only previously worked in various storyboard roles and one previous role in directing\nthe anime Great Dog Lassie (1996). Madhouse and Katabuchi together created a fast-paced action anime from start to finish with what seems to be a plethora of talented staff put\ninto different episode director roles from Tetsurou Araki to Atsushi Nigorikawa. If there was one common factor with the staff, it was they all knew how to do action well. The plot\nfor Black Lagoon starts with a standard Japanese salary man named Rokuro aka Rock later, beinggiven a task to take an item to a client for his boss. During this journey, pirates\nfrom the Black Lagoon Company rob the boat to acquire said item. Rocks boss deems him expendable in order to keep the item from being stolen, and therefore Rock somehow joins the\nBlack Lagoon Company and their crazy crew of misfits. From there, Rock and the crew live on a pirate island and attend everything from weapon deals to encounters with maid\nassassins. This is literally an anime about swearing, shooting things, and killing people. Its awesome.  Black Lagoon is straight-up violence featuring many themes showing up in\nanime at the time like girls-with-guns. Arguably the shows six strongest characters are all female from the main chick Revy to anime stereotypes like the maid assassin Roberta and\nthe Nun Eda a weapon smuggler. Somehow, the show slips into the show humorous scenes and dialogues during and after violent battles. Important to note that this show is gorgeously\nanimated and the hardcore music goes along with it so well.  Be it the bullet mode animation to blood splatter to the memorable cast of characters with borderline psychologic\ndisorders, Black Lagoon is unadulterated deviously vicious action insert F word anywhere in between.  Madhouse did the anime industry a favor by creating two fantastic seasons of\nthis show and cannot wait to ingest even more violence later.",

The only characteristic he has to go by is that the murderer has a claw for an arm, hence the murderer being referred to as The Claw Man. During his travels, Van happens to pass through the city of Evergreen, which is defending itself from bandits who aim to rob the city of its treasury. It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van's assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta. Surprisingly, Van learns that the bandits had ties with The Claw Man, and in kidnapping Wendy's brother for a reason they did not disclose. After the bandits are dealt with easily, Van and, much to his chagrin, Wendy continue the journey in search of The Claw Man. Little do they know, however, that The Claw Man is involved with something more atrocious than either could fathom."

Togame brazenly requests that Shichika help in her mission to collect twelve unique swords, known as the \"Deviant Blades,\" for the shogunate.

With the aid of \"NerveGear\" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts. Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed \"Kirito,\" is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game. In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell."

While they are physically superior to flesh-and-blood fighters, T-Dolls are incapable of formulating complex plans and thus require a human commander to issue orders.\n\nSangvis Ferri was an industry-leading T-Doll manufacturer until they attempted to install a specialized T-Doll as the company's sole commander—resulting in the immediate deaths of everyone at that facility.

         "ou Aida and Haruki Serizawa might seem like polar opposites to those around them, but as the two third-years prepare to end their high school experience, they couldn't have been been closer. While Miou is a shy and reserved member of the school art club that prefers to stay out of the limelight, Haruki is the boisterous and confident ace of the movie club, already winning awards for his directing prowess. However, after a previous chance encounter during their school entrance ceremony, they quickly become friends despite their stark differences in personality. But although their closeness might be growing, they've never become anything more than just that, much to the bewilderment of their friends. As their time in high school draws to a close, Miou and Haruki, along with their friends in the art and movie clubs, have just one year left to face their hidden feelings and the daunting task of deciding their future careers. The two might always be only an arm's reach away, but as Haruki chases his dream of becoming a professional movie director and Miou struggles with choosing a path for herself, they'll learn just how hard it is to get past those last 10 centimeters."

However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent. Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world."

When he sees a painting made by a member of the Art Club, Yatora becomes fascinated with the colors used in it. Later, in an art exercise, he tries to convey his language without words but instead through painting. After that experience, Yatora finds himself so invested in art that he decides that it is what he wants to do for a living.

         "At the start of the season I saw a new Idol anime was airing. Another series where i'll watch 3 or 4 episodes, maybe download the rhythm gatcha mobile game. What I actually got was\na show that shows the excitement of being an Idol Fan. Summary: A girl named Eripiyo's world is changed for the better when she walks by a small idol group preforming, there she\nwould meet Maina. Quickly she falls into the dark hole we know as being an intense Idol Fan. From buying out the merch table of Maina CDS to going to every concert, Eripiyo is a\ntrue Idol Fan. Allshe wishs is to see Maina succeed and be happy.  Thus the title \"If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die\"  Story(7.9): Very Slice-of-life,\njust Eripiyo and her fellow idol fans being idol fans. We see the struggles of waiting in the hot sun for a good seat, to your favorite idol liking all of her fans not just you.\nThe gang is very fun and their high-jinks are wonderful to watch. We also get to watch the members of ChamJam! grow as idols and learn what it takes to be an idol. Dealing with\nfans, understanding your character, the rules you must follow, etc.   Art(7.6): The art is good. There are stylized moments. I can't say much about it. It works for what the series\nneeds.  Sound(8.5): The background songs are good, not annoying. ChamJams! songs are good, not any i've listened to a bunch of times like other shows. It is idol music so those not\na fan of idol already might find the music not intresting.  Characters(10): Oh here it is, the place this anime shines. The characters are the series selling point, Eripyo alone is\nhours of entertainment. Her overreactions over the smallest thing, to her truly dedicating her life to supporting Maina. Her fellow idol fans are also amazing characters. Being the\nstereotype overweight idol otaku, and the skinny in love with an idol (who looks a lot like his sister) character. I am sure you will find them amazing if you give this series a\nfew episodes.  Enjoyment:(10) I only really like reviewing anime/manga when i'm passionate about them. This is one of them. I plan to buy the manga, and hope to get the bluerays\nwhen they come out. I am honestly going to miss watching this series every week. So did I enjoy it? Yes. YES. YES.  Overall:(9) I'm not going to tell you this is the greatest\nanime, because it is very much not. I will not say it is the greatest slice-of-life either. But it is not trying to be. This is simple a series looking at the joys of being a super\nidol fan. A wise anime fan once said that we love to watch characters who are passionate about something, you can feel their passion leak into you. That is the case here. I feel\nEripyo's excitement every time Maina does something cute or ChamJam! advances their idol career. I highly recommend giving this series a chance. Give it 2 or 3 episodes and I hope\nyou will at least enjoy it. The hidden gem of this season.",

This anime centers around the fans who see the idols and instead of the idols being popular they are highly underrated. They only have a few fans who actually watch and\nsupport them. This is an anime about the bond between a fan and an idol. An anime where popularity does not mean devotion. There's also legit Yuri. Not much but it exists.

         "Heroines Run the Show is an interesting look at idol culture through the lens of the companies responsible for it. Throughout the series, we get to see how the management team\nhandles LIPxLIP while trying to bridge the gap between the boys and their high school peers. The relationship that develops between Hiyori and her charges is mostly wholesome, even\ngoing so far as to subvert expectations a few times, particularly regarding Hiyori's more \"tomboy\" appearance. Aizo and Yujiro start out antagonistic toward her and each other, but\neven they can't remain immune to the power of the enthusiastic protagonist forever. Their dynamic is funto watch, but unfortunately Hiyori's background is the only one that feels\nmost fleshed out. Every other character that gets introduced in the show has their one story to explain their presence or motivation and they're sticking to it, whether they get\ndevelopment or not. That being said, it works for the episodic nature of the anime.  Since this is an idol show, of course there are plenty of fun performances to enjoy. Not only\ndo the episodes have their own sequences within the story, but the show as a whole showcases a handful of different EDs that feature the characters performing. Still, it's the\nstage shows that truly take the cake. The moment the idols take the stage to perform a song, the animation shift becomes just noticeable enough that it's weirdly uncanny. It isn't\nbad in the least, but it doesn't blend so seamlessly into the rest of the animation that it escapes the watchful eye either. It's so fluid that it's either rotoscope (most likely)\nor some very convincing CGI.  Unfortunately, what really leaves the biggest impression is the show's stance on idol culture and the fans who participate in it. It's nothing new for\nmedia about idols to focus on how the idols themselves need to work hard to impress their fans because anything that upsets the fans (and negatively impacts their popularity) is\nsomehow considered to be directly their fault, but this show goes another step further by trying to encourage obsessive behavior via the parasocial relationship these managerial\nteams try so hard to cultivate. Clearly, the stance it has taken on matters such as stalking and fan jealousy is a cop out so as to not upset the status quo. There is a small plea\nin the last episode for fans to think about who they're hurting before they act on their feelings, but it is largely overshadowed by affirmations that idols love and appreciate\ntheir fans and understand that these behaviors are signs that the fans love and support the idols back.  Overall, it's a fun show with entertaining characters and music. Definitely\nworth a watch if the idol genre is your thing.",

         "To follow non-idol fans... I don't like idol anime, and to be honest I despise the the idol culture in general, but I did really enjoy the Oshi no Ko despites it being an idol\nanime because Oshi no Ko is not about idol (season one at least) To non-idol funs unfortunately Oshi no Ko still is an idol anime that heavily influenced and based on idol culture,\nBUT fortunately the 'idol story' is really minimum that it doesn't play a big part in the story happened so far. To me the explanation of the mystery and the nature of the\nentertoyment industry is the center ofthe season, in fact I think the the Reality-TV show section has more screen time than the idol parts combine.   So for follow non-idol fans\ngive it a chance try to watch it for 5 minutes see if this show interested you (true story I was cringed out and dropped this anime months ago without 2 minutes in by the 'idol\ntalk' at the beginning of the anime, but now I have picked it up and benched the whole season in one day).  The story telling/writing is top tier and the 1hr+ long first episode is\na breath of fresh air a very bold decision but it gets the job done, it introduced and explained the mystery, the background, the main protagonists, and set the overall tone of the\nstory all at once. And the way stories are presented, the angle of the approach, the focus the the camera, the switching between point of views translates the information to the\naudience very well and connects the stories and keeps them in a consistent flow. Even as someone who despises the idol show as for the only 'idol event/show' the protagonists\nactually on the stage by how the show is portrayed that I still feel the cringe but I didn't hate it as much. This is a good anime despites if you like idol anime or not, it is\njust good, a good anime.  I only gave this season an 8/10 (pretty high score by itself), however I feel it could be higher because this season feels like a 'Part 1' this season\nmerely introduced the story and characters, a set up for potentially what will coming in the future. I will probably coming back to bump the score to a 9/10 after watching the\nseason 2 but for now as for what it is just this 11 episodes by themselves an 8/10 to me definitely worth a watch will recommend to all non-idol fans.",
